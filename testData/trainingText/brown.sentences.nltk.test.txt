<s> When this second dilemma first became obvious -- during the mid to late '50's -- the United States appeared to have three choices . </s>
<s> It could have continued testing to the full on the grounds that the radiation danger was far less than the danger of Communist world domination . </s>
<s> It is by no stretch of the imagination a happy choice and the arguments against it as a practical strategy are formidable . </s>
<s> In particular , Governor Nelson Rockefeller has expressed as cogently and clearly as anyone the case for a resumption of atmospheric tests . </s>
<s> What we need to realize is that the increasingly great contamination of the atmosphere by the Soviet tests had radically increased our own moral obligations . </s>

<s> The most surprising thing about the Twenty-second Congress of the Soviet Communist Party is that it is surprising -- perhaps quite as much , in its own way , as the Twentieth Congress of 1956 , which ended with that famous `` secret '' report on Stalin . </s>
<s> If one follows the reports of the Congress , one finds that there still seems considerable uncertainty in the minds of the leaders themselves about what exactly to do in this matter . </s>
<s> Over all these fairly awkward problems Khrushchev was to skate rather lightly ; ; </s>
<s> But one cannot escape the suspicion that all this non-stop harping on the misdeeds of the long liquidated `` anti-party '' group would be totally unnecessary if there were not , inside the party , some secret but genuine opposition to Khrushchev on vital doctrinal grounds , on the actual methods to be employed in the `` transition to communism '' and , last but not least , on foreign policy . </s>

<s> The Chinese , North Vietnamese and North Koreans , on the other hand , feel that , militarily , Russia is strong enough to support them in the `` just wars of liberation '' they would like to embark on before long : with China attacking Formosa and the North Koreans and North Vietnamese liberating the southern half of their respective countries . </s>

<s> Ellie Mao , soprano , and Frederick Fuller , baritone , presented a program of folksongs entitled `` East Meets West '' in Carnegie Recital Hall last night . </s>
<s> The performances were assured , communicative and pleasingly informal . </s>

<s> Miss Garland is not only one of the great singers of our time but she is one of the superb showmen . </s>
<s> There also came a brief contretemps with the sound mixers who made the mistake of being overheard during a quiet moment near the conclusion of `` Do It Again '' , and she made the tart observation that `` I never saw so much moving about in an audience '' . </s>
<s> The audience wouldn't let her leave until it had heard `` Over The Rainbow '' -- although the fellow that kept crying for `` Get Happy '' had to go home unhappy , about that item anyway . </s>
<s> In Newport last night there were flashes of distant lightning in the northern skies . </s>
<s> Mulligan's band has been infected with his solid sense of swing , and what it does seems far more meaningful than most of the noise generated by the big concert aggregations . </s>
<s> He met with enthusiastic audience approval , especially when he swung from jazz to Latin American things like the Mambo . </s>
<s> Divided almost equally into two parts , it consisted of `` The Evolution Of The Blues '' , narrated by Jon Hendricks , who had presented it last year at the Monterey , Calif. , Jazz Festival , and an hour-long session of Maynard Ferguson and his orchestra , a blasting big band . </s>
<s> Surprise addition </s>

<s> The young Texas pianist can make great chords ring out as well as anyone , so last night the massive sonorities of this challenging concerto were no hazard to him . </s>
<s> But they were not what distinguished his performance . </s>
<s> The elements that did were the introspective slow movement , the beautiful transition to the third movement , and the passages of filigree that laced through the bigger moments of the opening movement and the final Rondo . </s>
<s> Mr. Cliburn gave the slow movement some of the quality of a Chopin Nocturne . </s>
<s> And although there was plenty of vigor in the performance , the ensemble was at its best when the playing was soft and lyrical , yet full of the suppressed tension that is one of the hallmarks of Beethoven . </s>

<s> Mr. Herman has managed to mix musical ideas drawn from Israel and the standard American ballad style in a manner that stresses the basic tunefulness of both idioms . </s>
<s> With three fine Russian films in recent months on World War 2 , -- `` The House I Live In '' , `` The Cranes Are Flying '' and `` Ballad Of A Soldier '' -- we had every right to expect a real Soviet block-buster in `` The Day The War Ended '' . </s>

<s> There is Mijbil , an otter who travelled with Maxwell -- and gave Maxwell's name to a new species -- from the Tigris marshes to his London flat . </s>
<s> He preferred sleeping in bed with his head on a pillow . </s>
<s> With curiosity and elan , he explored every inch of glen , beach and burn , once stranding himself for hours on a ledge high up a sheer seventy-foot cliff and waiting with calm faith to be rescued by Maxwell , who nearly lost his life in doing so . </s>

<s> No doubt the underlying idea was to show that for all the elegance and artistry that have distinguished its presentations thus far , it too could give a circus if it pleased . </s>

<s> Nostalgia week at Lewisohn Stadium , which had begun with the appearance of the 70-year-old Mischa Elman on Tuesday night , continued last night as Lily Pons led the list of celebrities in an evening of French operatic excerpts . </s>

<s> As early as 1928 , however , the Sloan style began to change . </s>
<s> The dark pigments of the early work were superseded by a brighter palette . </s>
<s> The solidity of brush stroke yielded to a hatching technique that finally led to virtual abandonment of American genres in favor of single figure studies and studio nudes . </s>
<s> Sloan created such works for newspaper supplements before syndication threw him out of a job and sent him to roam the streets of New York , thereby building for America an incomparable city survey from paintings of McSorley's Saloon to breezy clotheslines on city roofs . </s>

<s> Despite a too long sustained declamatory flight , this final speech is convincing , and we see why British audiences apparently were impressed by `` Roots '' . </s>

<s> The only man alive who seems qualified by his learning , his disposition and his addiction to a baroque luxuriance of language to inherit the literary mantle of Sacheverell Sitwell , Mr. Sansom writes of foreign parts with a dedication to decoration worthy of a pastry chef creating a wedding cake for the marriage of a Hungarian beauty ( her third ) and an American multimillionaire ( his fourth ) . </s>

<s> Between the first meeting of Clerfayt and Lillian and this dismal denouement , Mr. Remarque has laid down many pages of junior-philosophical discourse , some demure and rather fetching love-making , pleasant talk about some of the countryside and restaurants of Europe , and a modicum of automobile racing . </s>

<s> In this same society , the plain citizen can with an average of only one-fifth his income buy more calories than he can consume . </s>
<s> Not all the concern for health is well directed . </s>
<s> From the fusty panaceas of spinach , eggs and prunes , the U.S. has progressed to curds , concentrates and capsules . </s>

<s> The man most firmly at grips with the problem is the University of Minnesota's Physiologist Ancel Keys , 57 , inventor of the wartime K ( for Keys ) ration and author of last year's bestselling Eat Well And Stay Well . </s>
<s> He has measured the skinfolds ( the fleshy areas under the shoulder blades ) of Neapolitan firemen , studied the metabolism of Finnish woodcutters , analyzed the `` mealie-meal '' eaten by Capetown coloreds , and experimented on Minneapolis businessmen . </s>
<s> Says Keys : `` Maybe if the idea got around again that obesity is immoral , the fat man would start to think '' . </s>
<s> He is particularly vulnerable to diabetes . </s>
<s> `` It contains large amounts of protein , vitamins and minerals . </s>
<s> That remarkable cholesterol . </s>
<s> When thus deposited , Keys says that cholesterol is mainly responsible for the arterial blockages that culminate in heart attacks . </s>
<s> The proteins and fats are burned off , and the cholesterol is left behind . </s>
<s> That same year the University of California's Dr. Laurance Kinsell , timing oxidation rates of blood fats , stumbled onto the discovery that many vegetable fats cause blood cholesterol levels to drop radically , while animal fats cause them to rise . </s>
<s> Yet in the contemporary context this is precisely what one must not do . </s>
<s> In such a world the words `` matter '' and `` spirit '' both referred to directly known realities in the common experience of all . </s>
<s> In carrying out this program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit . </s>
<s> The objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support . </s>
<s> For all involved in this discussion the devil is a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night , the demon world is populated with real creatures , and witches actually can be seen flying through the air . </s>
<s> If one asks about this play , what it is that comes upon this community and works within it with such terrible power , there is no better answer to give than `` spirit '' . </s>
<s> We cannot , of course , assign it any substance . </s>
<s> So it is too with many other spirits which we all know : the spirit of Nazism or Communism , school spirit , the spirit of a street corner gang or a football team , the spirit of Rotary or the Ku Klux Klan . </s>
<s> The idea of community and the idea of spirit are two distinct and separable ideas . </s>
<s> It is for them a given which they and they alone possess . </s>
<s> Although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation , the striking thing is the rapidity with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence . </s>
<s> This is especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle class . </s>
<s> The same thing is also evidenced by the extreme `` culture-Protestantism '' so often observed to characterize the preaching and teaching of the American churches . </s>
<s> Can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious ? ? </s>
<s> By analogy , the church also has been regarded as entirely independent of the `` world '' in the sense of requiring nothing from it in order to be the church . </s>
<s> Until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened men today can understand , we are depriving ourselves of the very resources on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends . </s>
<s> and though this process by no means represents an unambiguous gain and is , in fact , marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation , it is still a positive step forward ; ; </s>
<s> In affirming this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking the deadlock into which Bultmann's attempt to formulate such a theology has led . </s>
<s> and ( 3 ) in so doing , frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event Jesus Christ by means of statements that , from Bultmann's point of view , are mythological . </s>
<s> Many people seem hopeful , yet it is difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment of Christian unity in 1961 than there was in 1861 . </s>
<s> For the `` tide is well on the turn '' , as the London Catholic weekly Universe has written . </s>
<s> As an American Catholic of Irish ancestry , I came with certain preconceptions and expectations ; ; </s>
<s> She may not have been exact on this number , but others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less than ten . </s>
<s> Intercede for our separated brethren , that with us in the one true fold they may be united to the chief Shepherd , the vicar of thy Son . </s>
<s> The English saints are widely venerated , quite naturally , and now there is great hope that the Forty Martyrs and Cardinal Newman will soon be canonized . </s>
<s> The general tone of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the Manchester Guardian and the Sunday Observer implies a kindly recognition that the Catholic Church is now at least of equal stature in England with the Protestant churches . </s>
<s> Catholic priests have frequently appeared on television programs , sometimes discussing the Christian faith on an equal footing with Protestant clergymen . </s>
<s> A notable example of this was the discussion of Christian unity by the Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool , Dr. Heenan , and the Anglican Archbishop of York , Dr. Ramsey , recently appointed Archbishop of Canterbury . </s>
<s> English Catholics reacted to this event with moderate but real hope . </s>
<s> news of a Protestant minister in Leamington who has offered to allow a Catholic priest to preach from his pulpit ; ; </s>
<s> the startling statement in a respectable periodical that `` Catholics , if the present system is still in operation , will constitute almost one-third of the House of Lords in the next generation '' ; ; </s>
<s> Christianity declares that in the life and death of Jesus Christ the unique and the universal concur . </s>
<s> Perhaps no church father saw this concurrence of the unique and the universal as clearly , or formulated it as precisely , as Irenaeus . </s>
<s> Christ is both unique and universal . </s>
<s> As Origen interprets the end of history on the basis of its beginning , so Irenaeus portrays the story of Adam on the basis of the story of Christ . </s>
<s> Irenaeus does not claim pre-existence for the human soul ; ; </s>
<s> That parallelism affects his picture of man's disobedience too ; ; </s>
<s> and disobedience to God entails death . </s>
<s> This idea , which occurs in both Tatian and Cyprian , fits especially well into the scheme of Irenaeus' theology ; ; </s>
<s> It is borne out also by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation to the next . </s>
<s> They speak of the work of Christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility , which can mean ( though it does not have to mean ) deliverance from time and history . </s>
<s> The embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment , for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural order of time and change . </s>
<s> It is the wages of sin , and its sting is the law . </s>
<s> Even so , Gannett judiciously argued , the Association could legitimately decide that Parker `` should not be encouraged nor assisted in diffusing his opinions by those who differ from him in regard to their correctness '' . </s>
<s> Their demand against the Calvinist Orthodoxy for intellectual liberty had never meant that they would follow `` free inquiry '' to the extreme of proclaiming Christianity a `` natural '' religion . </s>
<s> Yet , even after all these stratagems , the conscience of Christian liberality is still not laid to rest , any more than is the conscience of Harvard University for having done the abject penance for its rejection of Ralph Waldo Emerson's The Divinity School Address of naming its hall of philosophy after him . </s>
<s> He still points an accusing finger at all of us , telling us we have neither the courage to support him nor the energy to cut his throat . </s>
<s> Actually , the dispute between Parker and the society of his time , both ecclesiastical and social , was a real one , a bitter one . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry of the populace ; ; </s>
<s> What otherwise could `` the lawyer , doctor , minister , the men of science and letters '' do when told that they had `` become the cherubim and seraphim and the three archangels who stood before the golden throne of the merchant , and continually cried , ' Holy , holy , holy is the Almighty Dollar ' `` ? ? </s>
<s> There are a great many bishops who have never had a cross on their bosom , nor a mitre on their head , who appeal not to the authority of the Pope at Rome , but to the Almighty Dollar , a pope much nearer home . </s>
<s> This was war . </s>
<s> Parker meant business . </s>
<s> Because he copiously shed his own tears , and yielded himself up as a living sacrifice to the impersonalized conscience of New England , he was not disturbed by the havoc he worked in other people's consciences . </s>
<s> I have , within the past fifty years , come out of all uncertainty into a faith which is a dominating conviction of the Truth and about which I have not a shadow of doubt . </s>
<s> Test it , try it , and if it works , accept it as a guiding principle . </s>
<s> As a short , possibly not the best method , I looked up `` Word '' in the Concordance and noted that the Bible claims from Genesis 1 to Revelation 22 to be God's personal message to man . </s>
<s> I believe , therefore , that we are without exception sinners , by nature alienated from God , and that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , came to earth , the representative Head of a new race , to die upon the cross and pay the penalty of the sin of the world , and that he who thus receives Christ as his personal Saviour is `` born again '' spiritually , with new privileges , appetites , and affections , destined to live and grow in His likeness forever . </s>
<s> The Bible is as obviously and truly food for the spirit as bread is food for the body . </s>
<s> It makes my work a great deal easier to be able to pray for the Lord's guidance while ministering to the physical needs of my patients . </s>
<s> `` God so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten Son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life '' , and `` as many as received him , to them gave He power to become the sons of God , even to them that believe on His name '' . </s>
<s> Unfortunately , in our rush to beat the Russians , we have forgotten these truth-packed words of Jesus Christ : `` What shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world ( that includes outer space ) , and lose his own soul ? ? </s>
<s> only a fool would think otherwise . </s>

<s> Never forget that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link . </s>
<s> Pleasure , fame and fortune , drowning your troubles with a drink , and `` living it up '' with the gang are like candy bars when you're hungry : they may ease your hunger temporarily , but they'll never take the place of a satisfying , mouth-watering steak . </s>
<s> So it is spiritually . </s>
<s> No amount of religious ceremonies or even joining a church will relieve the gnawing of your `` inner '' space . </s>
<s> Accept the sinless Son of God , Jesus Christ , as your own personal Saviour . </s>

<s> Watch people flock to amusement houses , cocktail lounges , and night clubs that advertise continuous entertainment , which means an endless flow of noise and frivolity by paid entertainers who are supposed to perform in those incredible ways which are designed to give men a few hours of dubious relaxation -- watch them and you can tell that many of them are running away from something . </s>

<s> This gets down to the heart of our problem , for it reconciles us with God , whom we fear most of all because we have sinned against Him . </s>

<s> To be reminded of this we need only glance at the world map and note the extent to which religious divisions have compounded political ones , with a resultant fragmentation of the human race . </s>
<s> As much as men intrinsically need the unity that is grounded in God , they instrumentally require the institutions that will direct their steps toward him . </s>
<s> Is there any way out of the predicament ? ? </s>
<s> It is the art of relating the finite to the infinite , of doing our best to insure that the particularistic requirements of religious institutions will not thwart God's intent of unity among men more than is minimally necessary . </s>
<s> What are the pertinent facts affecting such communication at the present juncture of history ? ? </s>
<s> I shall touch on three areas : personal , national , and theological . </s>
<s> Such needs may rise to pathological proportions . </s>
<s> Interfaith conflicts which spring from psychological deficiencies are the most unfortunate of all , for they have no redeeming features whatsoever . </s>
<s> While the personality factors that aggravate interfaith conflict may be perennial , nationalism is more variable . </s>
<s> Emerging from the two centuries of colonial domination , the Afro-Asian world is aflame with a nationalism that has undone empires . </s>
<s> But the problem extends elsewhere . </s>
<s> In 1960 Ceylon nationalized its sectarian -- preponderantly Christian -- schools , to the rejoicing of most of its 7,000,000 Buddhists and the lament of its 800,000 Roman Catholics . </s>
<s> I was seated next to the director of the Seventh Day Adventists' world radio program . </s>
<s> The partition of India has hardly improved relations between Hindus and Muslims ; ; </s>
<s> The modern world has been marked by progressive disaffection with claims to divine sanction for the state , whatever its political form . </s>
<s> During the years when Israel was passing from crisis to crisis -- the Sinai campaign , the infusion of multitudes of penniless immigrants -- it was felt that the purpose of national unity could be best served if the secular majority were to yield to the religious parties . </s>
<s> The Roman Catholic Church has excommunicated one of its priests , Father Feeney , for insisting that there is no salvation outside the visible church . </s>
<s> When they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to `` permit '' the termination of the human race by human action , because there could not possibly be any proportionate grave reason to justify such a thing , they know exactly what they mean . </s>
<s> Of course , in prudential calculation , in balancing the good directly intended and done against the evil unintended and indirectly done , no greater precision can be forthcoming than the subject allows . </s>
<s> He is talking about an action which just as efficaciously does an evil thing ( and is known certainly and unavoidably to lead to this evil result ) as it efficaciously does some good . </s>
<s> By contrast , a good deal of nuclear pacifism begins with the contingencies and the probabilities , and not with the moral nature of the action to be done ; ; </s>
<s> `` It is worse for a nation to give in to evil than to run the risk of annihilation '' . </s>
<s> Even Professor Arnold Toynbee , agreeing with his son , does so in these terms : `` Compared to continuing to incur a constant risk of the destruction of the human race , all other evils are lesser evils . </s>
<s> Mr. Philip Toynbee affirms at one point that if he shared the anticipations of Orwell in Nineteen Eighty-Four , if he believed Communism was not only evil but `` also irredeemably evil '' , then he might `` think it right to do anything rather than to take the risk of a communist world . </s>

<s> Professional responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient manner . </s>
<s> How explicit such factors have been historically is evident in any chronology of restrictive covenant cases or in a review of NAREB's Code of Ethics Article 34 in the Code , adopted in 1924 , states that `` a Realtor should never be instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood a character of property or occupancy , members of any race or nationality or any individuals whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property values in that neighborhood '' . </s>
<s> The rationale for this avoidance was most frequently expressed in economic terms ; ; </s>
<s> They would become tagged as men not interested in being purely real estate `` professionals '' but agitators for some kind of `` cause '' or `` reform '' , and this was no longer to be a `` pro '' . </s>
<s> It seems to us that choices exercised by realtors in moral situations center in at least three areas : ( 1 ) the various ways in which they interpret a particular social issue ; ; </s>
<s> ( 2 ) their pattern of involvement in the regular legal and political processes ; ; </s>
<s> Significantly , no realtor and few of the faculty present were familiar with any of the six volumes ( published by the University of California Press ) that present the commission's findings . </s>
<s> the attitude adopted by realtors and their associations , either negative or positive , plays a large part in the public acceptance of such measures and the degree to which they may be effectively enforced . </s>
<s> But as yet , no real estate board has been willing officially to support such laws or to admit the permissibility of introducing minority buyers into all-white neighborhoods . </s>
<s> A fragmented Society </s>
<s> If we look about the world today , we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization : science and religion . </s>
<s> Religion , or the lack of it , will decide whether we use this power to build a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind , or whether we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed . </s>

<s> To grasp our new view of the atom , we have to appreciate first of all how small the atom is . </s>
<s> Then I calculated that a million peas would just about fill a household refrigerator ; ; </s>
<s> These balls are moving in great circles and ellipses , and are of course , the electrons , the particles of negative electricity which by their action create the forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of my finger bone . </s>
<s> Since these electrons are moving like planets , you may wonder whether there is an atomic sun at the center of the atom . </s>
<s> Even if the atom were big enough to hold a football field , this nucleus is still only about the size of a pinhead . </s>

<s> Several of the movements were given a marked impetus by revivalism . </s>
<s> We cannot take the space to record all the efforts for the removal or alleviation of collective ills . </s>
<s> A few of the more prominent must serve as examples of what a complete listing and description would disclose . </s>
<s> As we have seen , Methodism early took a stand against slavery . </s>
<s> Benjamin Lundy ( 1789-1839 ) , a Quaker , was a pioneer in preparing the way for anti-slavery societies . </s>
<s> A marked impulse came to the anti-slavery movement through the Finney revivals . </s>
<s> Individuals possessing unusual gifts and great personal power were transmuted at death into awesome spirits ; ; </s>
<s> But this eminence was not without its weighty responsibilities . </s>
<s> The Chinese emperor , by proper observance of ritual , manifested divine powers . </s>
<s> and the daily duties of individuals were basically religious in nature . </s>
<s> If the moral code were flouted , the proper balance of the universe would be upset , and the disastrous result could be floods , plague , or famine . </s>
<s> In China , the magical system par excellence was Taoism . </s>
<s> Propriety was synonymous with ritual observance , the mark of a true gentleman . </s>
<s> Zen maintains that cognitive things are only the surface of experience . </s>
<s> One patriarch is supposed to have relegated sacred scriptures for use in an outhouse . </s>
<s> The technique of reality confusion -- the use of paradox and riddles to shake the mind's grip on reality -- originated with fourth and third century B.C. Chinese Quietism : the koan is not basically a new device . </s>
<s> Thus , the Mahayana metaphysic of mystical union for salvation was distilled down to a bare self-seeking , and for this reason , the mystic in Asia did not long remain in isolated contemplation . </s>
<s> As the Zen literature reveals , as soon as an early Zen master attained fame in seclusion , he was called out into the world to exercise his powers . </s>

<s> The minister was Norman Vincent Peale . </s>
<s> For example , early in my life , when one of my editorial workers wanted to find out how churches and philanthropic organizations met the needs of New York's down-and-outers , he didn't just ask questions . </s>
<s> Many of you are familiar , I'm sure , with the story of my early struggles : the fire in January , 1947 , that destroyed everything -- even our precious list of subscribers . </s>
<s> The crisis later on when debts seemed about to overwhelm me . </s>
<s> That was when a remarkable woman , Teresa Durlach , came to my aid -- not so much with money , as with wisdom and courage . </s>
<s> And the 100,000 subscribers became a reality . </s>

<s> Perhaps you think the editorial meetings are solemn affairs , a little sanctimonious ? ? </s>
<s> Not so . </s>
<s> Sharp division of opinion , too , and strenuous debate . </s>
<s> It takes many forms , this prayer , but in essence it is always a request for guidance , for open minds and gentle hearts , for honesty and sincerity , for the wisdom and the insights that will help Guideposts' readers . </s>
<s> My message , today , is the same as it was 15 years ago : that there is goodness in people , and strength and love in God . </s>
<s> Within a week , however , I began to suspect that something was wrong . </s>

<s> Far from discouraging Henri , his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments . </s>

<s> Seeing so many illustrations and reading so many testimonials to the value of Quick-Wate and Super-Protein , those two wonder-working Weider food supplements , he decided to try them and see what they could do for him . </s>
<s> For in almost less time than it takes to tell it , Henri's bodyweight was increasing rapidly . </s>
<s> Mr. Claude is a specialist in torso development and he has long favored the now-famous Weider Push-Pull Super-Set technique in which one exercise of the Super-Set is a pressing or `` pushing '' movement which accents one sector of a muscle group in a specific way , followed by a `` pulling '' exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group . </s>
<s> Super-Set No. 2 is made up of similar exercises , but this time done with dumbbells , and using both `` moon '' and flat benches . </s>
<s> In the third Push-Pull Super-Set the `` push '' exercise is the widegrip Pushup Between Bars , while the `` pull '' exercise is the Moon Bench Lateral Raise with bent arms . </s>
<s> As you see , the professor has designed a piece of apparatus that forces the bodybuilder to use a w-i-d-e grip . </s>
<s> But as you can also see , it's not a painful exercise at all , because Henri De Courcy -- the `` happy '' bodybuilder -- looks as though he were having the time of his life ! ! </s>
<s> The aspects of physical development that catch the judges' eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry and that hallmark of the true champion -- superior definition of the muscles . </s>

<s> The most beautiful bed of pansies I've seen was in a South Dakota yard on a sizzling day . </s>

<s> We put a light mulch over the seedlings ; ; </s>
<s> now we must use a heavy one . </s>
<s> If those aren't enough for you , why not grow some just for winter blooming ? ? </s>
<s> I started the seed in a flat in June and set out the little pansies in a cold frame . </s>
<s> Pick the flowers , keep the soil dampened , and each of the pegged-down branches will take root and become a little plant and go on blooming for the rest of the season . </s>
<s> They stick to their principles , insist upon their due , but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it . </s>
<s> Give them food , some shade , mulch , water and more food , and they'll repay your solicitude with beauty . </s>

<s> We must make certain that the aircraft is finished before we give the entire job to the missile . </s>
<s> Because of a missile's ballistic trajectory , the location of a fixed target must be known quite accurately . </s>
<s> Forces will survive a surprise attack , and these forces will give depth , or considerable duration , to the conflict . </s>
<s> Nuclear rockets can destroy airfields with ease . </s>
<s> but the airfield , on which the aircraft is completely dependent , is doomed by the missile . </s>
<s> Aircraft are mighty expensive if you can use them only once . </s>
<s> But remember this -- it isn't the aircraft which is vulnerable to nuclear rockets , it is the airfield . </s>
<s> There are four rather obvious ways to reduce or eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground : </s>
<s> We have the technology today with which to build aircraft shelters which could withstand at least 200 Aj . </s>
<s> We could put a portion of our strategic bombers in such shelters . </s>
<s> With such a force of manned bombers we could bring enormous pressure to bear on an enemy , and this pressure would be selective and extremely discriminating . </s>
<s> These crucial questions must be answered by post-attack reconnaissance . </s>
<s> If the target can change its position significantly during the 30 minutes the missile is in the air on its way , the probability of the missile destroying the target is drastically reduced . </s>
<s> Recently I was struck anew by the divergent approaches , when in the course of one afternoon and evening I listened to no fewer than ten different performances . </s>
<s> Let me say at the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as it did on the first . </s>
<s> But the most impressive testimony to Schnabel's distinction as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each student's approach as distinctly his own . </s>
<s> Yet no detail was too small to receive attention from this master , and as a result the playing here has humor , delicacy , and radiant humanity . </s>
<s> The piano performance on this Trout is one that really demands a search for superlatives . </s>
<s> The violinist , in particular , is very indulgent with swoops and slides , and his tone is pinched and edgy . </s>
<s> There is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the `` Forellen '' movement , and I suspect that this is due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original Aj . </s>

<s> Seen in perspective , many of these releases have a genuine claim to be milestones . </s>
<s> Since the concept of high fidelity became important some dozen years ago , the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold . </s>
<s> The effect of the recording is very open and natural , with the frequency emphasis exactly what you would expect from a live performance . </s>
<s> Yet you feel the orchestra is near at hand , and the individual instruments have the same firm presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically perfect hall . </s>

<s> The main set of bars are the `` tappets '' and one tappet is connected to each lever . </s>
<s> This is not necessarily to green , however , for in some situations only a yellow indication is given to a train to let it into the `` plant '' . </s>

<s> The old-time bridges over the Merrimac River in Massachusetts are of unusual interest in many respects . </s>
<s> For their length , their types of construction , their picturesque settings , and their literary associations , they should be known and remembered . </s>
<s> In this sequence I shall write about them in the order of their erection . </s>
<s> The matter was considered and reconsidered , and finally opposed , but in spite of many objections , the Court granted a charter on January 9 , 1792 . </s>
<s> `` It consists of two divisions , separated by an island at a small distance from the southern shore . </s>
<s> The whole length of Essex bridge is one thousand and thirty feet and its breadth thirty-four . </s>
<s> It is hardly necessary to remind students of covered bridges that Timothy Palmer was born in 1751 in nearby Rowley ; ; </s>
<s> The Essex Merrimack Bridge when first built was not covered . </s>
<s> A brief description accompanying the picture says that the bridge contained more than 6000 tons of timber . </s>
<s> and , although he later explained that he was talking French , it seems rather more likely that he had succumbed to the joys of the evening . </s>
<s> It reads : `` chain bridges </s>
<s> `` Mr. Palmer will attend to any applications relating to bridges and if desired will view the proposed site , and lay out and superintend the work , or recommend a suitable person to execute it . </s>
<s> The horse and men were saved , but the oxen drowned . </s>
<s> This second chain bridge was 570 feet long , had two thirty-foot towers and a draw , and a double roadway . </s>
<s> The bridge has survived the natural hazards of the elements , war , fire , and floods , as well as injuries incident to heavy traffic , for more than a hundred years . </s>
<s> It is one of the very few , if not the only surviving bridge of its type to serve a main artery of the U.S. highway system , thus it is far more than a relic of the horse and buggy days . </s>
<s> This covered , wooden bridge is so closely identified with the first action in the early morning of June 3 , 1861 , and with subsequent troop movements of both armies in the Philippi area that it has become a part and parcel of the war story . </s>
<s> Completed and opened for traffic in 1852 , the bridge was designed and built by Lemuel Chenoweth and his brother , Eli , of Beverly . </s>
<s> The Philippi bridge , however , was the Chenoweth master piece , with its 139-foot , dual lane , span -- and it stands today as a monument to its builders . </s>
<s> Union soldiers at times used it for sleeping quarters to escape from the rain or other inclement weather , and some of them left momentoes of their stay by carving their names and small tokens on its walls and beams . </s>
<s> General Jones was fresh from a long series of bridge burnings , including the long bridge at Fairmont , and , after seeing a great drove of horses and cattle he had collected safely across the bridge , he sent his men to work piling combustibles in and around it . </s>
<s> Reverend Joshual Corder , a Baptist minister , gathered a few citizens of Southern sympathies , to call on Jones and plead with him to spare the structure ; ; </s>
<s> he reasoned and argued , pointing out that Jones or other Confederate commanders would need it should troops pass that way in retreat . </s>
<s> Again Reverend Corder saved the bridge when Union soldiers planned to destroy it , after filling its two lanes with hay and straw -- but for what reason is not recorded nor remembered , certainly not because of pressure from an opposing Confederate force . </s>
<s> We speak from varying viewpoints . </s>
<s> It may be a big hole in the ground filled with salt hay , or an ice floe studded with logs . </s>
<s> Eight years ago while we were going through the mud-sweat-and-tears construction period , we were each solaced by the vision of early morning dips and evening home-comings to a cool family collected around the pool with a buffet table laid out nearby for the lord and master's delectation . </s>
<s> Since our viewpoints in this respect coincided precisely , we present the fruits of our efforts herewith as a single social code for pool owners . </s>
<s> No friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at least telephoning beforehand . </s>
<s> No ringers , either -- even if they are trailing legitimate invitees . </s>
<s> And accompanying adults are urged to keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities . </s>
<s> This has saved us from constant requests seven days a week and made us feel less brutal to the young `` less fortunate '' than ours . </s>
<s> We gently usher them to an island of tables and chairs strategically placed on the far side of the pool where they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge sides . </s>
<s> All bottles must be kept a safe distance away from the pool and drinking glasses are banned in favor of plastic or metal cups . </s>
<s> Preserving the pool </s>
<s> A sudden high rise in temperature will turn your pool poison green overnight . </s>
<s> You need more chlorine . </s>
<s> Much of the dirt and leaf stain is easily removed when damp , but requires dynamite if allowed to dry . </s>

<s> Draw a line across the country at the latitude of lower Pennsylvania . </s>
<s> Home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflicted . </s>
<s> We know now that a 15-degree differential in temperature is the maximum usually desirable , and accurate controls assure the comfort we want . </s>
<s> Housekeeping is easier . </s>
<s> It will improve your disposition . </s>
<s> When you're less fatigued , things just naturally look brighter . </s>
<s> You'll sleep longer and better , too , awake refreshed and free of hot weather nerves . </s>
<s> Best of all , central air conditioning is something you can afford . </s>
<s> No matter what style your home is , ranch , two-story , Colonial or contemporary , central air conditioning is easily installed . </s>
<s> Manufacturers have designed equipment for just such circumstances , and your savings over starting from scratch will be substantial . </s>
<s> This costs less than having a completely separate cooling system , for your regular heating ductwork , filters and furnace blower do double duty for cooling . </s>
<s> The cooling coil is located in the furnace's outlet . </s>
<s> You can get a hot water system that will also work for cooling your house . </s>
<s> One of the more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched to heating . </s>
<s> As you know , a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping the heat out of it and then releasing this heat outdoors . </s>
<s> Cooling requirements are best expressed in terms of Aj . </s>
<s> A very rough rule of thumb is that , under favorable conditions , you'll need 15 BTU's of cooling for every square foot of your house . </s>
<s> Don't urge your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be sure you have enough . </s>
<s> In a new house , generous roof overhangs are a logical and effective solution . </s>
<s> Drawn blinds and draperies do some good , but not nearly as much as shading devices on the outside of the house . </s>
<s> The more directly the sun strikes walls and roof , the greater its heat impact . </s>
<s> Gas adds to the moisture load . </s>
<s> Good workmanship is important in the installation , so if you're doing your own contracting , don't award the job on the basis of price alone . </s>
<s> you must have a list of requirements on where , how many , and what type sites are needed . </s>
<s> These are becoming more and more available through the work of counties and other government agencies . </s>
<s> It is usually helpful to make a sketch map in the field , showing the size and location of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site . </s>
<s> Naturally , a park site with scenic views , a good lake , trees , and sand dunes , will attract more people than a nearby area with only trees and dunes . </s>
<s> Note extent of these interests and how available they will be for the public to enjoy . </s>
<s> Water interest is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation site . </s>
<s> Most park planners look to water frontage for basic park areas . </s>
<s> a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant or dry in late summer . </s>
<s> Fishing interest calls for a check of the species found , quantity and size , the season they are available , and the stocking program of the fish commission . </s>
<s> Park visitors are always eager to learn more about the area they are in . </s>
<s> -- The values of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands , ownership and use of the land , and the utilities available there . </s>
<s> For instance , a site adjoining other publicly owned lands , such as a national forest or a public road , may be desirable , whereas a site next to an industrial plant might not . </s>
<s> Check the elevation of the ground , degree and direction of slopes , drainage , rock outcrops , topsoil types and quality , as well as subsoil . </s>
<s> Nearly level areas are required for parking areas , beaches , camp areas , ballfields , etcetera . </s>
<s> Lack of rainfall and extreme temperatures may call for the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable . </s>
<s> -- Some areas may already have been improved and contain buildings , roads , utilities , cleared land , etcetera which may raise the cost of the site . </s>
<s> and with sober purpose , because the development of Prokofieff personifies , in many ways , the course of music in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics . </s>
<s> Prokofieff's outlook as a composer-pianist-conductor in America was , indeed , brilliant . </s>
<s> Certainly its composer was an ascending star on a new world horizon . </s>
<s> I remember Ernest Bloch in the foyer , shouting in his high-pitched voice : `` it may be a tour de force , mais mon Dieu , can anyone take this music seriously '' ? ? </s>
<s> In this world-wide conscription of men , minds , and machines , Prokofieff was recalled to his native land . </s>
<s> a world beset with new boundaries , new treaties and governments , new goals and methods , and the age-old fears of aggression and subjugation -- hunger and exposure . </s>
<s> One might have expected that such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative flair of a composer , especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous . </s>
<s> By 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his people : `` I have striven for clarity and melodious idiom , but at the same time I have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the accepted methods of harmony and melody . </s>
<s> In orchestration , he stretches the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination for color . </s>
<s> His sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable . </s>
<s> Also , it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic modulations , the brilliant orchestrations , the adroitness for evading the heaviness of figured bass , the skill in florid counterpoint were not lost in his mature output , even in the spectacular historical dramas of the stage and cinema , where a large , dramatic canvas of sound was required . </s>
<s> Prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero , who , by the force of his creative life , helped preserve the main stream of tradition , to which the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually added and integrated . </s>

<s> Out of this background of hunting and fishing , it was only natural that Roy first painted subjects he knew best : hunters in the field , fishermen in the stream , ducks and geese on the wing -- almost always against a vast backdrop of weather landscape . </s>
<s> Gradually he withdrew from the shop altogether , and for the past thirty years , he has worked independently as a painter , except for his continued hunting and fishing expeditions . </s>
<s> Except for a rich friendship with the painter , Chauncey Ryder who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had -- and this was limited to a few lessons , though the two artists often went on painting trips together -- Roy developed his art by himself . </s>

<s> Chapter 8 , is entitled `` On Magnetism '' and in it are included such remarks as , `` One has always been tempted to compare the magnetic forces with the electrical forces . </s>

<s> Ideal for merchandising use , they are weather-resistant , and have mounting pegs on the back which fit into openings in a vacuum-formed waffle-pattern background panel . </s>
<s> For large letters , e.g. thermoformed of acrylic or butyrate , there are other techniques . </s>
<s> The fact that even the larger letters weighed only 5 lb. each made it possible to secure the letters to the building through clear acrylic angle brackets cemented to the letters . </s>

<s> Made in lengths from 3 to 10 ft. , the bars are shaped in cross section to provide a secure fit for the tapered slots molded in back of the letters . </s>

<s> `` The majority of children in the United States could benefit by some form of orthodontic treatment '' , says Dr. Allan G. Brodie , professor and head of the department of orthodontics at the University of Illinois and a nationally recognized authority in his field . </s>
<s> How can they tell whether a child needs orthodontic treatment ? ? </s>
<s> Crooked , overlapping , twisted , or widely spaced teeth . </s>
<s> It's perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs , and no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two or three years old . </s>
<s> Malocclusion can also result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long . </s>
<s> every orthodontist sees children who are embarrassed by their malformed teeth . </s>
<s> In certain cases , as in Dick Stewart's , a child's personality is affected . </s>
<s> This serious condition , popularly known as pyorrhea , is one of the chief causes of tooth loss in adults . </s>
<s> In the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of teeth is usually completed , yet the continuing growth of bony tissue makes moving badly placed teeth comparatively easy . </s>
<s> Abnormal pressure , applied over a period of time , produces a change in the bony deposit , so a tooth functions normally in the new position into which it has been guided . </s>
<s> `` Moving one or two teeth can affect the whole system , and an ill-conceived plan of treatment can disrupt the growth pattern of a child's face '' . </s>
<s> During the first few days of wearing the appliance and immediately following each adjustment , Susan may have a slight discomfort or soreness , but after a short time this will disappear . </s>
<s> But because teeth sometimes may drift back to their original position , a retaining appliance is used to lock them in place . </s>
<s> Then comes the time when the last wire is removed and Susie walks out a healthier and more attractive girl than when she first went to the orthodontist . </s>
<s> How long will this take ? ? </s>
<s> The charge for a complete full-banded job differs in various parts of the country . </s>
<s> Work that might cost $500 to $750 in the South could cost $750 to $1,200 in New York City or Chicago . </s>
<s> `` Factors in the cost of treatment are the length of time involved and the skill and education of the practitioner '' , says Dr. Brodie . </s>
<s> The reason ? ? </s>
<s> People today are aware of the value of orthodontics , and as a result there are more practitioners in the field . </s>
<s> Most orthodontists require an initial payment to cover the cost of diagnostic materials and construction of the appliances , but usually the remainder of the cost may be spread over a period of months or years . </s>
<s> Some municipal agencies will pay for orthodontic treatment for children of needy parents . </s>
<s> Dr. Brodie has 30-year records of head growth , started 20 minutes after children's births . </s>
<s> This knowledge both modifies and dictates diagnosis and treatment . </s>
<s> The child is kept on call , and the orthodontist watches the growth . </s>

<s> Not all , as a matter of fact , consider themselves `` mediums '' in the sense of receiving messages from the deceased . </s>

<s> Here again laboratory approaches are being evolved , for it is recognized how `` elastic '' these readings can be , how they can apply to many people , and are often stated in general terms all too easily applied to any individual's own case . </s>
<s> And even more complex items can be interpreted to conform to one's own point of view , which is by nature so personal . </s>
<s> It is very important indeed , in the field of extra-sensory perception and its relation to the survival hypothesis , to know whether the statements are actually only those which any intuitive person might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself . </s>
<s> All these evaluations are then totted up and tabulated , by adding up the Hits and Significants , with the weight placed on those in the sitter's own reading . </s>
<s> That is , if he marks as most correct a reading not meant for him , the total experimental score falls . </s>
<s> In another approach to the same procedure , the content of the readings is analyzed so as to see how the particular medium is likely to slant her statements . </s>

<s> This may be true whether the farm is owned or rented . </s>
<s> This is a highly speculative venture . </s>
<s> When surplus land is not expensive to buy or to keep up , it is usually better to buy it than to buy so small an acreage that the development of adjoining properties might impair the residential value of the farm . </s>
<s> If you are not well acquainted with the area in which you wish to locate , or if you are not sure that you and your family will like and make a success of farming , usually you would do better to rent a place for a year or two before you buy . </s>

<s> Author of the Albany Plan Of Union , which , had it been adopted , might have avoided the Revolution , he fought the colonists' front-line battles in London , negotiated the treaty of alliance with France and the peace that ended the war , headed the state government of Pennsylvania , and exercised an important moderating influence at the Federal Convention . </s>
<s> If Franklin was an authentic genius , then Alexander Hamilton , with his exceptional precocity , consuming energy , and high ambition , was a political prodigy . </s>
<s> His bold fiscal program and his broad interpretation of the Constitution stand as durable contributions . </s>
<s> He played the leading role in negotiating the treaty with Great Britain that ended the Revolution , and directed America's foreign affairs throughout the Confederation period . </s>
<s> Capable of enduring friendships , they were also stout controversialists , who could write with a drop of vitriol on their pens . </s>
<s> The Seven Founders were completely dedicated to the public service . </s>
<s> When the Revolution broke out , he , along with Jefferson and Jay , abandoned his career at the bar , with considerable financial sacrifice . </s>
<s> Hamilton was bent over his desk , drafting a legal paper by the light of a candle . </s>
<s> The Frenchman was astonished . </s>
<s> Jay had participated in the decision that exiled his old friend Van Schaack . </s>
<s> The latter in turn assured him that `` were I arraigned at the bar , and you my judge , I should expect to stand or fall only by the merits of my cause '' . </s>
<s> `` We have now a national character to establish '' , Washington wrote in 1783 . </s>

<s> the list is , obviously , endless . </s>
<s> Today the Negro must discover his role in an industrialized South , which indicates that the racial aspect of the Southern dilemma hasn't changed radically , but rather has gradually come to be reflected in this new context , this new coat of paint . </s>
<s> While there may still be many Faulknerian Lucas Beauchamps scattered through the rural South , such men appear to be a vanishing breed . </s>
<s> Presenting an individualized Negro character , it would seem , is one of the most difficult assignments a Southern writer could tackle ; ; </s>
<s> In the meantime , while the South has been undergoing this phenomenal modernization that is so disappointing to the curious Yankee , Southern writers have certainly done little to reflect and promote their region's progress . </s>
<s> Not a single Southern author , major or minor , has made the urban problems of an urban South his primary source material . </s>
<s> Faulkner , for one , appears to be safe from the accusing fingers of all assailants in this regard . </s>
<s> Faulkner culminates the Southern legend perhaps more masterfully than it has ever been , or could ever be , done . </s>
<s> Yet his concern even here is with a slowly changing socio-economic order in general , and he never deals with such specific aspects of this change as the urban and industrial impact . </s>
<s> Yet he presents a realm of source material which may well serve other writers if not himself : the problems with which a New South must grapple in groping through a blind adolescence into the maturity of urbanization . </s>
<s> He has designed a matching backdrop and costumes of points of color on white for Mr. Cunningham's Summerspace , so that dancers and background merge into a shimmering unity . </s>
<s> The depersonalization continued as the dancer was further metamorphosed by the play of lights upon his figure . </s>

<s> He disdains external restrictions -- conventional syntax , traditional metre . </s>
<s> An earlier but still influential school of painting , surrealism , had suggested the way of dealing with the dream experience , that event in which seemingly incongruous objects are linked together through the curious associations of the subconscious . </s>
<s> The contemporary painter tends to depict not the concrete objects of his experience but their essences as revealed in abstractions of their lines , colors , masses , and energies . </s>
<s> Others look to more objective devices of order . </s>
<s> The composer may reverse or invert the order of his original set of intervals ( or rhythms or dynamic changes ) . </s>
<s> Looking back , Miss Marsicano feels that her ideas may have been influenced by those of Jackson Pollock . </s>
<s> It may be a free front-back swing of the leg , leading to a sideways swing of the arm that develops into a turn and the sensation of taking off from the ground . </s>
<s> Though he is also concerned with freeing dance from pedestrian modes of activity , Merce Cunningham has selected a very different method for achieving his aim . </s>
<s> He bases his approach on the belief that anything can follow anything . </s>
<s> Thus , there is freshness not only in the individual movements of the dance but in the shape of their continuity as well . </s>
<s> The sequence of movements in a Cunningham dance is unlike any sequence to be seen in life . </s>

<s> The Constitution of the Southern `` Confederation '' differed from that of the Federal Union only in two important respects : It openly , defiantly , recognized slavery -- an institution which the Southerners of 1787 , even though they continued it , found so impossible to reconcile with freedom that they carefully avoided mentioning the word in the Federal Constitution . </s>
<s> '' The other important difference between the two Constitutions was that the President of the Confederacy held office for six ( instead of four ) years , and was limited to one term . </s>

<s> On their decisive battlefield Lincoln did not distinguish between them when he paid tribute to the `` brave men , living and dead , who fought here '' . </s>
<s> To my knowledge , Lincoln remains the only Head of State and Commander-in-Chief who , while fighting a fearful war whose issue was in doubt , proved man enough to say this publicly -- to give his foe the benefit of the fact that in all human truth there is some error , and in all our error , some truth . </s>

<s> It is from this unpromising background that the fictional private detective was recruited . </s>
<s> On the one hand , he does not work for a large agency , but is almost always self-employed . </s>
<s> Whatever his original assignment , the fictional private eye ends up by investigating and solving a crime , usually a murder . </s>
<s> At the same time , because the personal code of the detective coincides with the legal dictates of his society , because he likes to catch criminals , he is in middle class eyes a virtuous man . </s>
<s> He is an individualist but not an anarchist ; ; </s>
<s> Now , although the roots of the mystery story in serious literature go back as far as Balzac , Dickens , and Poe , it was not until the closing decades of the 19th century that the private detective became an established figure in popular fiction . </s>
<s> Sherlock Holmes is not merely an individualist ; ; </s>
<s> he is a recluse , an incredible egotist , a confirmed misogynist . </s>
<s> His eccentricity begins as a defense against boredom . </s>
<s> It was in order to avoid the stuffy routine of middle class life that Holmes became a detective in the first place . </s>
<s> but the society which he serves bores him to tears . </s>
<s> Although he is perfectly willing to cooperate with Scotland Yard , Holmes has nothing but contempt for the intelligence and mentality of the police . </s>
<s> They for their part are convinced that Holmes is too `` unorthodox '' and `` theoretical '' to make a good detective . </s>
<s> The two men resemble each other closely in their cunning , their egotism , their relentlessness . </s>
<s> Their dedication to the status quo has been affirmed at the expense of the fascinating but dangerous individualism of a Sherlock Holmes . </s>
<s> But unlike Holmes , he feels his society to be not merely dull but also corrupt . </s>
<s> he is not an eccentric but rather an outcast . </s>
<s> A similar tone of underlying futility and despair pervades the spy thrillers of Eric Ambler and dominates the most famous of all American mystery stories , Dashiell Hammett's The Maltese Falcon . </s>
<s> Finally , in The Maltese Falcon among others , the clash between detective and police is carried to its logical conclusion : Sam Spade becomes the chief murder suspect . </s>
<s> If the detective insists upon retaining his personal standards , he must now do so in conscious defiance of his society . </s>
<s> The information is furnished by each of the guests , is sent by oral broadcasting over the air waves , and is received by the ears . </s>
<s> We assume for this illustration that the size of the land plots is so great that the distance between dwellings is greater than the voice can carry and that most of the communication is between nearest neighbors only , as shown in Figure 2 . </s>
<s> In any social system in which communications have an importance comparable with that of production and other human factors , a point like f in Figure 2 would ( other things being equal ) be the dwelling place for the community leader , while e and h would house the next most important citizens . </s>
<s> A point like p gets information directly from n , but all information beyond n is indirectly relayed through n . </s>
<s> Since the hazards of poor communication are so great , p can be justified as a habitable site only on the basis of unusual productivity such as is made available by a waterfall for milling purposes , a mine , or a sugar maple camp . </s>
<s> They also furnish proof that , in modern war , message sending must be monitored . </s>
<s> Next to the old problem of the slowness of decision making , network structure seems to be paramount , and without monitoring no network has value . </s>
<s> The monitoring is the highest and most restrictive of any organization in existence . </s>
<s> and are combinable into sequences which permit any marching maneuver that could be desired on a parade ground . </s>
<s> With troops dispersed on fields of battle rather than on the parade ground , it may seem that a certain amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines of communication . </s>

<s> We hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have not enough generalists who can see the over-all picture and combine our national skills and knowledge for useful purposes . </s>
<s> Those familiar with his work will remember that he placed the incipience of the democratic faith at around 1850 . </s>
<s> But in every period it has been humanism '' . </s>
<s> It seemed to me that the liberals had scrapped the balanced polarity and reposed both liberty and the fundamental law in the common man . </s>
<s> Yet , after Rousseau had given the social contract a new twist with his notion of the General Will , the same philosophy , it may be said , became the idea source of the French Revolution also . </s>
<s> The long road that had taken liberals in this country into the social religion of democracy , into a worship of man , led logically to the Marxist dream of a classless society under a Socialist State . </s>
<s> And the ussr existed as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism , the ultimate exemplar . </s>
<s> And by the time the war ended , liberal leadership in this country was spiritually Marxist . </s>
<s> During the next five years liberal leaders in the United States sank in the cumulative confusion attendant upon and manifested in a negative policy of Containment -- and the bitterest irony -- enforced and enforceable only by threat of a weapon that we felt the greatest distaste for but could not abandon : the atom bomb . </s>
<s> But I have been at some pains to review it as the drama of the common man , to point up what happened to him under Eisenhower's leadership . </s>
<s> I will assume that we are all aware of the continuing struggle , with its limited and precarious success , toward conservatism . </s>
<s> What I am here to do is to report on the gyrations of the struggle -- a struggle that amounts to self-redefinition -- to see if we can predict its future course . </s>
<s> This is , however , symptomatic of our national malaise . </s>
<s> Only Walter Lippman envisioned the possibility of our having `` outlived most of what we used to regard as the program of our national purposes '' . </s>
<s> Father Murray goes back to the Declaration of Independence , too , though I may add , with considerably more historical perception . </s>
<s> So an objective look at our present procedures may move us to consider seriously this possibly analogous situation . </s>
<s> In any event , whether society may have cancer , or merely a virus infection , the `` disease '' , we shall find , is political , economical , social , and even medical . </s>
<s> Naturally this includes all communication forms , e.g. languages , or any social , political , economic or religious structures employed for such control . </s>
<s> So we must first analyze our present institutions with respect to the effect of each on man's major needs . </s>
<s> When we `` forced '' individuals to assume the corporate structure by means of taxes and other legal statutes , we adopted what I would term `` pseudo-capitalism '' and so took a major step toward socialism . </s>
<s> But the pseudo-capitalism which dictates our whole economy as well as our politics and social life , will not stand close scrutiny . </s>
<s> It serves only its own stockholders and poorly at that . </s>
<s> As a creative enterprise , its abilities are primarily in `` swallowing '' creative enterprises developed outside its own organization ( an ability made possible by us , and almost mandatory ) . </s>
<s> But while the corporation has all the disadvantages of the socialist form of organization ( so cumbersome it cannot constructively do much of anything not compatible with its need to perpetuate itself and maintain its status quo ) , unluckily it does not have the desirable aspect of socialism , the motivation to operate for the benefit of society as a whole . </s>
<s> Avoiding runaway technology can be done only by assuring a humane society ; ; </s>
<s> It can project long-range goals for itself . </s>
<s> Corporations are apt by nature to be impersonal , inhumane , shortsighted and almost exclusively profit-motivated , a picture they could scarcely afford to present to the public . </s>
<s> Proprietorships should get the tax advantages now accruing to corporations , e.g. the chance to accumulate capital so vital for growth . </s>
<s> Individual human strength is needed to pit against an inhuman condition . </s>
<s> Persons developed in today's corporations cannot hope to serve here -- a judgment based on experiences of my own in business and in activities outside . </s>
<s> They give strict interpretation to William James' statement that `` Every idea that enters the mind tends to express itself '' . </s>
<s> The writer took a class of college students to the state hospital for the mentally ill in St. Joseph , Missouri . </s>
<s> Despite the clarity of his presentation , his idea was not of Einsteinian calibre . </s>
<s> But have we not gone overboard in stressing their significance ? ? </s>

<s> It would have been unwise policy , for instance , to apply the pound-of-flesh characterization to the thrifty Scotchman . </s>

<s> That doctrine has been accepted by many , but has it produced good results ? ? </s>
<s> In time she presents her aristocratic husband with a coal-black child . </s>
<s> Ideas need to be tested , and not merely by argument and debate . </s>
<s> The merits of the Salk anti-polio vaccine were not established on the forensic platform or in newspaper editorials , but in the laboratory and by tests in the field on thousands of children . </s>
<s> Debate rid us of McCarthy but did not give us much that is positive . </s>
<s> The discussion of professional ethics inevitably reminded us that in the historical perspective the President's decision will finally clarify itself as a moral , rather than a medical , problem . </s>
<s> And though we can look back now and see their errors , we can look back also to the ultimate error . </s>
<s> In this case others should not have had to raise the doubts and fears . </s>
<s> At the national and international level , then , what is the highest kind of morality for the private citizen represents an instance of political immorality . </s>
<s> Nothing testifies more clearly to that cleavage than the peculiar editorial page appearing in a July issue of Life Magazine , the issue which also carried the second announcement of the candidacy . </s>
<s> The double editorial on Two Aspects Of `` The U.S. Spirit '' was subtly calculated to suggest a moral sanction for gambles great as well as small , reflecting popular approval of this questionable attitude toward the highest office in the land . </s>
<s> In any other man this reassurance to the electorate would have caused us a profound moral shock . </s>
<s> Only recently , and perhaps because a television debate can so effectively dramatize President Kennedy's extraordinary mastery of detail , have the abilities on which the capacity for making distinctions depend begun to be clearly discernible at the level of politics . </s>
<s> These ways are absolutely irreconcilable because they offer two different recipes for man's redemption from chaos . </s>
<s> There the community , faced with the need to formulate policy on the level of absolute justice , can find the answer to its problem in the absolute truth which it holds as partially experienced . </s>
<s> Its ontological status is itself most tenuous because apart from individual men , who are its `` matter '' , tradition , the `` form '' of society exists only as a shared perception of truth . </s>
<s> Those social , civilizational factors not rooted in the human spirit of the group , ultimately cease to exist . </s>
<s> Civilization itself -- tradition -- falls out of existence when the human spirit itself becomes confused . </s>
<s> Its massive contours are rooted in the simple need of man , since he is always incomplete , to complete himself . </s>
<s> Thus , it is no mystical intuition , but an analyzable conception to say that man and his tradition can `` fall out of existence '' . </s>
<s> Unanalyzed responses </s>
<s> The process of erosion need only undermine the tradition and a series of consequences begin unfolding within the individual , while in institutions a quiet but deep transformation of processes occurs . </s>
<s> Within institutions there is a marked decline of the process of persuasion and the substitution of a force-fear process which masquerades as the earlier one of persuasion . </s>
<s> These responses are explicable in terms of characteristics inherent in the crisis . </s>
<s> The implicit assumption of this response is that history is reversible . </s>
<s> Their great error is to mingle the responses typical of each of the three types of change . </s>
<s> In its defensive formulations , the theory will attack conscious change on the grounds of the independent existence of the community . </s>
<s> It is a total situation that is defended : the `` good old days '' . </s>

<s> In America , Meyer Schapiro observed that , unlike the Mondrian school , Helion `` sought a return path to the fullness of nature within the framework of abstract art '' . </s>
<s> but , he held , instead of continuing as an `` art of reduction '' , it must grow , must make a place for the contributions of the Raphaels and Poussins as well as for those of the early cubists and Mondrian . </s>
<s> Later Helion wrote of this phase : `` For years I built for myself a subtle instrument of relationships -- colors and forms without a name . </s>

<s> The tradition reached its apex , perhaps , in the works of Thomas Nelson Page toward the end of the century , and reappeared undiminished as late as 1934 in the best-selling novel So Red The Rose , by Stark Young . </s>
<s> Although Faulkner was the heir in his own family to this tradition , he did not have Stark Young's inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize the planter society . </s>
<s> It may be that in this comment he has broken from the conventional pattern more violently than in any other regard , for the treatment in his books is far removed from even the genial irony of Ellen Glasgow , who was the only important novelist before him to challenge the conventional picture of planter society . </s>

<s> and George Washington Harris , whose Tennessee hillbilly character Sut Lovingood perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain than any other character in literature . </s>
<s> It would be profitable , I believe , to read these realistic humorists alongside Faulkner's works , the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly , but rather that they dealt a hundred years ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our time , to Faulkner's time . </s>
<s> As a consequence of the tensions thus produced in his thoughts and feelings , he wrote on the one hand sketches of idealized hunting trips and on the other an anecdote of the village of Hardscrabble , Arkansas , where no one had ever seen a piano ; ; </s>
<s> and he wrote also the masterpiece of frontier humor , `` The Big Bear Of Arkansas '' , in which earthy realism is placed alongside the exaggeration of the backwoods tall-tale and the awe with which man contemplates the grandeur and the mysteries of nature . </s>

<s> And now there was some question as to his continued residence there . </s>
<s> From her California headquarters , Miriam fired back , `` I shall never divorce Mr. Wright , to permit him to marry Olga Milanoff '' . </s>
<s> Then Miriam varied the senseless psychological warfare by suddenly withdrawing a suit for separate maintenance that had been pending , and asking for divorce on the grounds of cruelty , with the understanding that Wright would not contest it . </s>
<s> This exhausted Wright's patience , and in consequence he talked freely to reporters in a Madison hotel suite . </s>
<s> If Mrs. Wright doesn't accept the terms in the morning , I'll go either to Tokyo or to Holland , to do what I can . </s>
<s> Here Wright gave a slight sigh of weariness , and continued , `` It means more long years lived across the social grain of the life of our people , making shift to live in the face of popular disrespect and misunderstanding as I best can for myself and those dependent upon me '' . </s>

<s> Whether you experienced the passion of desire I have , of course , no way of knowing , nor indeed have I wished with even the most fleeting fragment of a wish to know , for the fact that one constitutes by one's mere existence so to speak the proof of some sort of passion makes any speculation upon this part of one's parents' experience more immodest , more scandalizing , more deeply unwelcome than an obscenity from a stranger . </s>

<s> Modern psychiatric knowledge provides us with many keys to unlock the significance of behavior of the kind . </s>
<s> Undoubtedly , however , the significance of the volume is greater than the foregoing paragraphs suggest . </s>
<s> My reply is that I associate myself with all those who affirm that Gentile-Jewish relations should contribute to the theory and practice of human dignity . </s>
<s> If Jews are identified as a religious body in a controversy that comes before a national or international tribunal , it is obviously compatible with the goal of human dignity to protect freedom of worship . </s>
<s> However , in the context of legal and civic policy , these controversies are less than novel . </s>
<s> Properly used , the present book is an excellent instrument of enlightenment . </s>
<s> For what we propose , however , a psychoanalyst is not necessary , even though one aim is to enable the reader to get beneath his own defenses -- his defenses of himself to himself . </s>
<s> For this purpose a degree of intellectual and emotional involvement is necessary ; ; </s>
<s> The second timely part of this sketch of literature and the search for identity has to do with the difference between good and enduring literary works and the ephemeral mass culture products of today . </s>
<s> The reader , observing this process , might ask `` why not be different '' ? ? </s>
<s> A fourth view is the transformation of emotion , as in Housman's fine phrase on the arts : they `` transform and beautify our inner nature '' . </s>
<s> A sketch of the emotional value of the study of literature would have to take account of all of these . </s>
<s> Anyone who has watched children develop a taste for literature will understand what I mean . </s>
<s> It is at least possible that the capacity to postpone gratification is developed as well as expressed in a continuous and guided exposure to great literature . </s>
<s> But to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential leap . </s>
<s> It is the obverse of triviality , shallowness , emotional anaesthesia . </s>
<s> We are all , though many of us are snobbish enough to wish to deny it , in far closer sympathy with the art of the music-hall and picture-palace than with Chaucer and Cimabue , or even Shakespeare and Titian . </s>
<s> By an effort of historical sympathy we can cast our minds back into the art of a remote past or an alien present , and enjoy the carvings of cavemen and Japanese colour-prints ; ; </s>
<s> When we assert the value of such study , we find ourselves committed to an important assumption . </s>
<s> Many will add that we may find our enjoyment heightened by our understanding . </s>
<s> This understanding , of course , may in its turn take many forms and some of these -- especially those most interesting to the student of comparative literature -- are essentially historical . </s>
<s> But , in general , we may argue that the student can direct the primary emphasis of his attention toward one or the other . </s>
<s> At this point a working definition of idea is in order , although our first definition will have to be qualified somewhat as we proceed . </s>
<s> In this essay , we are , along with most historians , interested in the more general or more inclusive ideas , that are so to speak `` writ large '' in history of literature where they recur continually . </s>
<s> also secondary notions such as the perfectibility of man , the depravity of man , and the dignity of man . </s>
<s> The actual moments of contact are vitally important . </s>
<s> This reading and the comments that it evoked constitute the influence . </s>
<s> Hegel's profound admiration for the insights of the Greek tragedians indicates a broad channel of classical influence upon nineteenth-century philosophy . </s>
<s> Six of the railroads carrying coal to Tidewater from the Pennsylvania fields , Hearst said , not only had illegal agreements with coal operators but owned outright at least eleven mines . </s>
<s> Roosevelt and others considered him partly responsible for the murder of McKinley . </s>
<s> He ordered his editors to tone down on sensationalism and to refrain from using such words as `` seduction '' , `` rape '' , `` abortion '' , `` criminal assault '' and `` born out of wedlock '' . </s>
<s> The alternative to this is that if a conservative candidate is nominated the national committee will have to appeal to the trusts for their campaign funds , and in doing this will incur obligations which would make a Democratic victory absolutely fruitless . </s>
<s> It has been a long time since he has seen any campaign money , and when the proposition is laid down to him as the friends of Mr. Hearst are laying it down these days he is quite likely to get aboard the Hearst bandwagon '' . </s>
<s> `` The nomination of Hearst would compass the ruin of the party '' , Carmack said . </s>
<s> The talk of a Hearst `` barrel '' was increasing . </s>
<s> Koenigsberg never did learn what Hearst wanted , for the latter shook hands and moved toward the door . </s>
<s> He took the stack of mail and tossed it into the waste basket . </s>
<s> But I do not have to be bribed by office to be a Democrat . </s>
<s> Trevelyan's Liberalism was above all a liberalism of the spirit , a deep feeling of communion with men fighting for country and for liberty . </s>
<s> His personal familiarity with the scenes of action undoubtedly contributed much to the final result , but familiarity alone would not have been enough without other qualities . </s>
<s> Military knowledge , love of detail , and a sure feeling for the portrayal of action were the added ingredients . </s>
<s> In looking back over the volumes , it is possible to find errors of interpretation , some of which were not so evident at the time of writing . </s>
<s> The biography of Lord Grey is strictly speaking not a biography at all . </s>
<s> The result was fortunate . </s>
<s> The strength of the History is also its weakness . </s>
<s> Like his volume on Wycliffe , the work was accompanied by the publication of a selected group of documents , in this case illustrative of the history of Queen Anne's reign down to 1707 . </s>
<s> The account of the battle is , next to his descriptions of Garibaldi's campaigns , Trevelyan's outstanding military narrative . </s>
<s> The scene is etched in sharp detail , the military problems brilliantly explained , and the excitement and importance of the battle made evident . </s>
<s> If only for this modest masterpiece of military history , Blenheim is likely to be read and reread long after newer interpretations have perhaps altered our picture of the Marlborough wars . </s>
<s> I stood on a table , surrounded by hundreds of expectant young faces . </s>
<s> After making a short statement about human rights , and the freedom to travel , I told them I would be going to the Kehl bridge the next morning in order to cross the Rhine into Germany . </s>
<s> `` Well , I might not get that far '' , I told them , `` as actually I have no papers to enter Germany and , as a matter of fact , no permit to return to France once I leave '' . </s>
<s> We would all meet at ten o'clock at the Kehl bridge , five miles from Strasbourg , and march triumphantly across into Germany . </s>
<s> Alarmed by this display of weapons , I looked toward the bridge and there saw , stretched across the near side , a cordon of policemen , their bicycles forming a roadblock before which stood several French officers in uniform and a small waspish man in a brown derby . </s>
<s> The waspish man stopped me three paces from the bicycle barricade , and asked me in French if I had papers to leave France . </s>
<s> He examined it carefully , handed it back and said , `` Eh bien , you may leave France '' . </s>
<s> `` Alors , you may go no farther '' , he said imperiously . </s>
<s> `` But I have no permission to re-enter France , and I have just left '' , I told him . </s>
<s> I have witnesses . </s>
<s> And as you know , I have no permission to re-enter France once out . </s>
<s> `` Mais non '' , the Interior Ministry man coaxed , `` you may come back to Strasbourg , now , if you wish '' . </s>
<s> `` I shall see about getting you a tent '' , he said . </s>
<s> That would be a great help , I told him , thanking him for his thoughtfulness . </s>
<s> Her name was Esther Peter . </s>
<s> Each evening the students appeared with the soup kettle and several petits pains , Esther usually being among them . </s>
<s> I had advised friends to write me to `` No Man's Land , Pont Kehl , Between Strasbourg and Kehl , France-Germany '' . </s>
<s> In the mail were invitations to speak at the universities of Cologne , Heidelberg , and Baden-Baden . </s>
<s> As it began raining at around eight o'clock on December 26th , I retired into my tent early , somewhat tired and discouraged , my body reacting sluggishly because of the continued exposure . </s>
<s> A voice drifted in to me above the patter of the rain shortly after I had fallen into a fitful sleep . </s>
<s> `` I'm sorry . </s>
<s> I've had a trying day and I just can't make it out again '' , I told them . </s>
<s> At that moment , up walked a tall young man with glasses who announced himself as a world citizen from Basel , Switzerland . </s>
<s> Esther jumped up , ran to him and gave him a little hug . </s>
<s> `` I am so happy . </s>
<s> There is a police car outside . </s>
<s> Such were the incongruities of the situation that the very police assigned to check up on me were drafted into driving me to the Strasbourg Hospital while World Citizen Jean Babel waved adieu from the `` Line '' ! ! </s>
<s> The measure of combat efficiency in an indecisive campaign is a matter of personal choice . </s>
<s> Lincoln was sure that he would not be re-elected . </s>
<s> In the midst of this gloom , at 10:05 P.M. on September 2 , Slocum's telegram to Stanton , `` General Sherman has taken Atlanta '' , shattered the talk of a negotiated peace and boosted Lincoln into the White House . </s>
<s> Grant called it prompt , skillful and brilliant . </s>
<s> Next best to destroying an army is to deprive it of its freedom of action . </s>
<s> But , so far as its territorial objectives were concerned , the campaign was successful . </s>
<s> The skirmishing was almost constant . </s>
<s> Men were killed in their camps , at their meals and in their sleep . </s>
<s> Sherman proved that a railway base could be movable and the most brilliant feature of the Atlanta campaign was the rapid repair of the tracks . </s>
<s> The fossilized , formalized , precedent-based thinking of the legendary military brain was not evident in Sherman's armies . </s>
<s> Sherman could never be accused of sticking too long with the old . </s>
<s> He never saw that it was a complement to his infantry and not a substitute for it . </s>
<s> It failed to work . </s>
<s> Every recorded request by Thomas for a delay in a flank movement or an advance was to gain time to take care of his horses . </s>
<s> To relieve the itch and sweat galls , the men got into the water whenever they could and since each sizable stream was generally the dividing line between the armies the pickets declared a private truce while the men went swimming . </s>
<s> Most of the Rebels got away since they could make better time through the stiff brush than their naked pursuers . </s>
<s> Consequently , on October 31 , 1896 , Mrs. King wrote to Thompson , quite against her daughter's wishes , asking him not to `` recommence a correspondence which I believe has been dropped for some weeks '' . </s>

<s> I never had the courage to look at them , when my projected volume became hopeless , fearing they were poor , until now when I was obliged to do so . </s>

<s> It was very stimulating . </s>
<s> The sand is fine and pleasant , the cabanas are clean , and the parasols , green , raspberry , and butter yellow , are very gay . </s>
<s> the atmosphere is that of an attractive private beach club at home . </s>
<s> The public may still find pleasure in public places . </s>
<s> The other is that the charge for cabanas and parasols , though modest from an American point of view , still is a little high for many Athenians . </s>

<s> Woodruff said nothing , and Pike , frustrated , stormed throughout Little Rock in an unsuccessful search for `` Vale '' , asking his friends to keep their ears open . </s>
<s> In the next few months of comparative silence , Pike waited patiently until conditions were perfect for a new attack , and then , displaying a remarkable grasp of the subtleties of political infighting , gained from his first bout with Woodruff , he used these changed conditions to excellent advantage . </s>
<s> One-armed , gruff , frugally honest , Governor Pope had been the ideal man to assume office in Arkansas after the disgraceful antics of political bosses like Crittenden , and he ruled the state with an iron fist , tolerating no nonsense . </s>
<s> This warm relationship came to an abrupt end in June of 1834 when the National Congress appropriated $3,000 for compiling and printing the laws of Arkansas Territory , and , taking note of the recent wave of corruption in the legislature , left it to the governor to award the contract . </s>
<s> Woodruff was now impaled on the horns of a dilemma . </s>
<s> And , for the moment at least , the governor now found himself allied with the head of the Crittenden faction he had formerly opposed , and Pike was credited with a clear triumph over Woodruff . </s>
<s> He was especially popular with women , for , like the romantic poetry he wrote , he was personally gracious , gallant , and chivalrous . </s>
<s> He again began to play the violin , and tucking the instrument beneath his chin , performed soulful and romantic airs to match the expressions on the faces of the lovely women who gathered to hear him . </s>
<s> His artistic accomplishments guaranteed him entry into any social gathering . </s>

<s> Upon intelligence that the formidable agitator was to favor them with his presence , the benighted inhabitants of Pawtuxet , alas , gave their allegiance to Massachusetts and asked that colony to expel the newcomers . </s>

<s> You may do well to take notice , that besides the title to land between the English and the Indians there , there are twelve of the English that have subscribed their names to horrible and detestable blasphemies , who are rather to be judged as blasphemous than they should delude us by winning time under pretence of arbitration '' . </s>
<s> The attack started on October 2 , 1643 , and the Gortonists held out for a day and a night . </s>
<s> Gorton and ten of his friends were thrown in jail . </s>

<s> We may further grant to those of her ( Poetry's ) defenders who are lovers of poetry and yet not poets , the permission to speak in prose on her behalf : let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to States and to human life , and we will listen in a kindly spirit ; ; </s>
<s> In the ideal state , for instance , he argues that the young citizens should hear only the most carefully selected tales and stories . </s>
<s> In Aristotle's analysis of tragedy in the Poetics , we find an attempt to isolate the art , to consider only those things proper to it , to discover how it differs from other arts , and to deal with the effects peculiar to it . </s>

<s> Both sides claimed that Plato and Aristotle supported their cause . </s>
<s> Those who wanted to close the theaters , for example , pointed to Plato's Republic and those who wished to keep them open called on the Plato of the Ion to testify in their behalf . </s>
<s> Second , we will see how Sidney answered the charges , for while Sidney's essay was not specifically a reply to Gosson , his arguments do support the new theater . </s>
<s> Even in such technical curricula as engineering , the senior is much more likely than the freshman to choose , as an ideal , liberal education over specific vocational preparation . </s>
<s> In the university milieu of scholarship and research , of social diversity , of new ideas and varied and wide-ranging interests , `` socialization '' into a campus culture apparently means heightened appreciation of the idea of a liberal education in the arts and sciences . </s>

<s> Although the laws of the various states , in general , specify the situs of property , i.e. , residence or domicile of the owner , or location of the property , the exceptions regarding boats , airplanes , mobile homes , etc. , seem to add to the uncertainty of the proper origination point for assessment . </s>

<s> This problem of fair and equitable assessment of value is a difficult one to solve in that the determination of fair valuation is dependent on local assessors , who in general are non-professional and part-time personnel taking an individualistic approach to the problem . </s>
<s> The most realistic way of facing up to this problem would be to have the State take over full responsibility for assessing all taxable property . </s>
<s> Practices in Rhode Island . </s>
<s> There are legitimate reasons for differences of opinion among the assessors as a whole and among the public officials in each town . </s>
<s> These opinions of the assessors are of significance in indicating what their thinking seems to be at the present time . </s>
<s> It would seem , then , that movable property and equipment is not taxed as a whole but that certain types are taxed in towns where this is bound to be expedient for that particular kind of personal property . </s>
<s> Another question that was asked of the assessors was whether they favored the assessment of movable property at its location or at the residence of the owner . </s>
<s> It has been obvious to the assessors , particularly those in shore communities , that boats comprise the largest category of tangible personal property which they have been unable to reach . </s>
<s> Only a few more than 10,000 boats had been registered with the Division of Harbors and Rivers at the end of the 1960 boating season , but many had been taken out of the water early when the threat of a hurricane brought the season to an early close . </s>

<s> This type of borrowing can be reduced to a minimum if quarterly installment payment of taxes is instituted and the first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal year . </s>
<s> It should be noted that there are other and equally important reasons for establishing meaningful intergovernmental reporting bases on a uniform fiscal year . </s>
<s> Although there are many sound reasons for adopting uniform and coordinated fiscal years in Rhode Island , there are also certain difficulties encountered . </s>
<s> It should be kept in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can convert to the proposed plan is directly dependent upon the financial condition of that town or city . </s>
<s> Fortunately , there are no cities or towns in the state , with one or two possible exceptions that are in too difficult a position to finance the proposed change . </s>

<s> Other factors playing a part in the extent of AM service and interference are the frequency involved , the time of year , the position of the year in the sunspot cycle , ground conductivity along the transmission path , atmospheric and manmade noise , and others . </s>
<s> The 20-to-1 ratio for cochannel interference embodies one of the fundamental limiting principles which we must always take into account in AM assignments and allocations -- that signals from a particular station are potential sources of objectionable interference over an area much greater than that within which they provide useful service . </s>
<s> This is a phenomenon familiar to all radio listeners , resulting from reflection of skywave signals at night from the ionized layer in the upper atmosphere known as the ionosphere . </s>
<s> Because of the difference between daytime and nighttime propagation conditions , it has been necessary to evolve different allocation structures for daytime and nighttime broadcasting in the AM band , with many more stations operating during the day than at night . </s>
<s> 5 . </s>
<s> ( 3 ) </s>
<s> Accordingly , the Commission has recognized that an optimum allocation pattern for one frequency does not necessarily represent the best pattern for other frequencies , and has assigned different frequencies for use by different classes of stations . </s>
<s> Since the provision of skywave service requires adequate freedom from interference , only class 1 , stations are capable of rendering skywave service . </s>
<s> As mentioned , the primary allocation objective to be followed in the allocation of stations on clear channels is the provision of widespread service , free from destructive interference . </s>
<s> In the daytime , on the other hand , since skywave transmission is relatively inefficient , it is possible to assign a substantially larger number of stations on these channels . </s>
<s> In 1947 , affidavits were filed with the Commission by various clear-channel stations alleging that extensive interference was being caused to the service areas of these stations during daylight hours , from class 2 , stations whose signals were being reflected from the ionosphere so as to create skywave intereference . </s>

<s> The results of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses ( e.g. , Garstung , 1958 ) . </s>
<s> Radio observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets . </s>
<s> For the case of Jupiter , the radio emission spectrum is definitely not like the spectrum of a black-body radiator , and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non-thermal components . </s>
<s> Mars has been observed twice at about 3-cm wave length , and the intensity of the observed radiation is in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which might be predicted on the basis of the known temperature of Mars . </s>
<s> that the amplitude of the variation was considerably less than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared emission as measured by Pettit and Nicholson ( 1930 ) and Pettit ( 1935 ) ; ; </s>
<s> Steady radiation which was presumably of thermal origin was observed from Venus at 3.15 and 9.4 cm , and from Mars and Jupiter at 3.15 cm in 1956 ( Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker , 1958 , A , B , C ) , and from Saturn at 3.75 cm in 1957 ( Drake and Ewen , 1958 ) . </s>
<s> This is much smaller than the highest resolution of even the very large reflectors now under construction , and consequently the radio emission of different regions of the disk cannot be resolved . </s>
<s> At meter wave lengths an increase of the order of 10-degrees in the average disk temperatures of the nearer planets would be expected . </s>
<s> Such high-resolution observations as these are needed at several wave lengths in order that the radio emission of the moon can be properly interpreted . </s>
<s> The ratio of the measured antenna temperature change during a drift scan across the moon to the average brightness temperature of the moon over the antenna beam ( assuming that the brightness temperature of the sky is negligible ) was found , by graphical integration of the antenna directivity diagram , to be 0.85 . </s>

<s> The anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount . </s>
<s> 2 . </s>
<s> The heat transfer to the anode in free burning arcs is enhanced by a hot gas jet flowing from the cathode towards the anode with velocities up Af . </s>
<s> The pressure gradient producing the jet is due to the nature of the magnetic field in the arc ( rapid decrease of current density from cathode to the anode ) . </s>
<s> It is apparent from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements for the anode of free burning arcs are large compared with those for the cathode . </s>
<s> The use of high voltages and low currents by proper design to reduce electron heat transfer to the anode for a given power output . </s>
<s> The purpose of the present study is to study the thermal conditions and to establish an energy balance for a transpiration cooled anode as well as the effect of blowing on the arc voltage . </s>
<s> Argon was used as a blowing gas to exclude any effects of dissociation or chemical reaction . </s>
<s> The anode material was porous graphite . </s>
<s> The cathode consisted of a 1/4'' '' diameter thoriated tungsten rod attached to a water cooled copper tube . </s>
<s> The transpiring gas ejected from the anode formed a jet directed axially towards the cathode below . </s>
<s> To reduce heat transfer from the hot gas to this anode holder outside the regime of the arc , a carbon shield was attached to the surface providing an air gap of 1/16 inch between the plate and the surface of the anode holder . </s>
<s> In addition , the inner surface of the carbon shield was covered with aluminum foil to reduce radiation . </s>
<s> The power source was a commercial D. C. rectifier . </s>
<s> Experimental procedure and error analysis </s>
<s> The anode holder shown in figure 2 was designed with two goals in mind . </s>
<s> The upper limit was determined by the difficulty of measuring the characteristic anode surface temperature ( see below ) since only a small region of the anode was struck by the arc . </s>
<s> For each mass flow rate the arc voltage was measured . </s>
<s> To measure the surface temperature of the anode plug , the surface was scanned with a pyrometer . </s>
<s> Simultaneously with the anode surface temperature and voltage measurements pyrometer readings were taken along the cylindrical surface of the carbon anode holder as indicated on figure 2 . </s>
<s> It was calculated from the temperature gradient Af at Af inch as Af . </s>
<s> A band viscometer is shown in Figure 2 . </s>
<s> A back pressure was then introduced , and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicated which was greater , the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure . </s>
<s> It is presumed that this negative head was associated with some geometric factor of the assembly , since different readings were obtained with the same fluid and the only apparent difference was the assembly and disassembly of the apparatus . </s>
<s> This negative pressure is not explained by the velocity head Af since this is not sufficient to explain the readings by several magnitudes . </s>
<s> Such an instrument is expected to be especially useful if it could be used to measure the elasticity of heavy pastes such as printing inks , paints , adhesives , molten plastics , and bread dough , for the elasticity is related to those various properties termed `` length '' , `` shortness '' , `` spinnability '' , etc. , which are usually judged by subjective methods at present . </s>
<s> Af is the work necessary to fill the manometer column from the reference height to H . </s>
<s> The minimum total potential energy is found by taking the derivative with respect to H and equating to zero . </s>
<s> Essentially these birefringence studies show that at low rates of shear a tension is present at 45-degrees to the direction of shear , and as the rate of shear increases , the direction of the maximum tension moves asymptotically toward the direction of shear . </s>
<s> These droplets are distorted by the normal forces just as a balloon would be pulled or pressed out of shape in one's hands . </s>
<s> ( Some suspensions break up before they are near to the direction of shear , and some become asymptotic to it without breakup . </s>
<s> Just as the pressure exerted by surface tension in a spherical drop is Af and the pressure exerted by surface tension on a cylindrical shape is Af , the pressure exerted by any curved surface is Af , where **yg is the interfacial tension and Af and Af are the two radii of curvature . </s>
<s> Measurements on the photograph in this paper give Af at the maximum rate of shear of Af . </s>
<s> Its value was Af from the above data . </s>
<s> This appears to be high , as would be expected from the appreciable viscosity of the material in the drops . </s>
<s> There is a well-known relationship between probability and entropy which states that Af , where **zq is the probability that state ( i.e. , volume for an ideal gas ) could be reached by chance alone . </s>
<s> This conformational entropy is , in this case , equal to the usual entropy , for there are no other changes or other energies involved . </s>
<s> A proton magnetic resonance study of polycrystalline Af as a function of magnetic field and temperature is presented . </s>
<s> An isotropic resonance shift of Af to lower applied fields indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine contact interaction . </s>
<s> The theory predicts a linear dependence of Af on Af , where J is the experimentally determined Curie-Weiss constant . </s>
<s> The nuclear dipole effects provide some information on the motions of the hydrogen nuclei , but the symmetry of the Af bond in Af remains in doubt . </s>
<s> It is important to consider and experimentally verify this influence since quantitative nuclear resonance is becoming increasingly used in investigations of structure . </s>
<s> The information provided by the electron paramagnetic effects is then discussed , and finally the nuclear effects are interpreted in terms of various motional-modified models of the Af bond in Af . </s>
<s> This space group requires the hydrogen bond to be symmetric . </s>
<s> The only effect of lack of a center would then be to release the hydrogen atoms to occupy general , rather than special , positions along the ( 111 ) axis . </s>
<s> A randomization of `` ups '' and `` downs '' is more likely than ordered `` ups '' and `` downs '' in position ( 3 ) since the hydrogen atoms are well separated and so the position of one could hardly affect the position of another , and also since ordered `` up '' and `` down '' implies a larger unit cell , for which no evidence exists . </s>
<s> Dr. Douglass was kind enough to lend us about 5 grams of his material . </s>
<s> This material proved to be unsatisfactory , since we could not obtain reproducible results on various portions of the sample . </s>
<s> However , Af adsorbs water from the atmosphere and this may account for the low chromium analysis and high total weight loss . </s>
<s> The magnetic resonance absorption was detected by employing a Varian model Af broad line spectrometer and the associated 12-inch electromagnet system . </s>
<s> One measurement at 40 Mc/sec was obtained with the Varian model Af unit . </s>
<s> The rf power level was maintained small enough at all times to prevent obvious line shape distortions by saturation effects . </s>

<s> Spectra were obtained over the temperature range of 77 - 294-degrees-K . </s>

<s> Polyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants were a threat though expensive , and these same polyphosphates spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited . </s>
<s> The market today for detergent builders is quite diverse . </s>
<s> These widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up to 50% by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate . </s>
<s> Many scouring powders now also contain phosphates . </s>
<s> An oversimplified differentiation between soft- and hard-surface cleaning lies in the magnitude and kind of surface involved . </s>
<s> In contrast , a metal coupon Af in size would have a magnitude from 100,000 to a million less . </s>
<s> Spring used a Brush surface-analyzer in a metal-cleaning study and showed considerable differences in soil removal , depending upon surface roughness . </s>

<s> Introduction </s>
<s> The reaction of chlorine with carbon tetrachloride seemed particularly suited for such studies . </s>
<s> It should be possible to free carbon tetrachloride of any interfering substances by the usual purification methods followed by prechlorination prior to addition of radioactive chlorine . </s>
<s> The reactants for the gas phase experiments were first frozen out in a side-arm attached to the manifold and then allowed to distil slowly into the manifold of pre-cooled reaction cells before sealing off . </s>
<s> Following reaction the cells were scratched with a file and opened under a 20% aqueous sodium iodide solution . </s>
<s> No correlation between these variables and the irreproducibility of the results was found . </s>
<s> In most cases the chlorine concentration was about Af . </s>
<s> No detectable reaction was found at room temperature for reaction mixtures allowed to stand up to 5 hours . </s>
<s> Exchange was also observed in these cells , which had chlorine present at Af . </s>
<s> Wyatt and Whipple , 1950 ) , which is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive force of the impinging solar radiation , causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much shorter than the age of the Earth . </s>
<s> Even in the neighborhood of the Earth , where information has been obtained both directly and indirectly , the derived flux values vary by at least four orders of magnitude . </s>
<s> The impact rate on 1958 Alpha for 153 events was Af for particles of mass greater than Af ( Dubin , 1960 ) ; ; </s>
<s> this mass threshold was derived from the detector calibration and an assumed impact velocity of Af . </s>
<s> Many workers believe that the response is proportional to the incident momentum of the particles , a relation deduced from laboratory results linearly extrapolated to meteoritic velocities . </s>
<s> There is a difference in the experimental arrangement , in that the U.S. microphones are attached directly to the vehicle skin while the Russian instruments are isolated from the skin . </s>
<s> The threshold mass is derived from the momentum threshold with the assumption of a mean impact velocity of Af in the U.S. work and Af in the U.S.S.R. work . </s>
<s> The mass scale used in Table 5-1 was derived on the assumption that the motion of the glowing trail is related to the momentum transfer to the trail by the meteorite , permitting the calculation of the mass if the velocity is known ( Cook and Whipple , 1958 ) . </s>
<s> Therefore , N is inversely proportional to the radius cubed and in fair agreement with the inverse 7/2 power derived from 1958 Alpha and 1959 Eta data . </s>
<s> The extrapolation may be in error for several reasons . </s>
<s> Indirect indications of micrometeorite flux </s>
<s> Most meteoritic material , by the time it reaches the Earth's surface , has been reduced to dust or to spherules of ablated material in its passage through the atmosphere . </s>
<s> Present data indicate an accretion of about Af tons per year over the entire globe , or about Af . </s>
<s> Biological warfare </s>
<s> Biological warfare is considered to be primarily a strategic weapon . </s>
<s> The major reason for this is that it has no quick-kill effect . </s>
<s> An important operational procedure in BW for an enemy would be to create an areosol or cloud of agent over the target area . </s>
<s> The importance of particle size in such aerosols has been thoroughly demonstrated . </s>
<s> For example , bright sunlight is rapidly destructive for living microorganisms suspended in air . </s>
<s> There may be a number of secondary effects resulting from diffusion through buildings such as widespread contamination of kitchens , restaurants , food stores , hospitals , etc. . </s>
<s> The behavior of a biological aerosol , on a much smaller scale , is illustrated by a specific field trial conducted with a non-pathogenic organism . </s>
<s> These were located at the homes of Government employees , in Government Offices , buildings and reservations within the trial area . </s>
<s> All samplers were operated for a period of two hours except one , which was operated for four hours . </s>
<s> It must be remembered , however , that there are many agents for which there is no solid immunity and a partial or low-grade immunity may be broken by an appropriate dose of agent . </s>
<s> There is a broad spectrum of organisms from which selection for a specified military purpose might be made . </s>
<s> They argue further ( and somewhat contradictorily ) that our knowledge and resources in preventive medicine would make it possible to control such an outbreak of disease . </s>
<s> This , of course , does not eliminate from consideration for this purpose agents that are associated naturally with epidemic disease . </s>
<s> No epidemic was initiated nor was one expected because the population in City A was not lousy . </s>
<s> Biological agents are , moreover , suitable for delivery through enemy sabotage which imposes many problems in defense . </s>
<s> This is an enormous industry that is subject to sabotage . </s>
<s> Huge industries are involved also in the production of biological products , drugs and cosmetics which are liable to this type of attack . </s>
<s> Speer and coworkers , in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole sera , used a series of gradients for elution from Aj . </s>
<s> The red cells were used within 2 days after donation and were washed with large amounts of saline before use . </s>
<s> The cells were washed three times with saline , anti-human serum was added , the cells were resuspended , and the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min and examined for agglutination . </s>
<s> The cells were then washed three times with saline and resuspended to 2% in saline . </s>
<s> The small amount of insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis was suspended in approximately 5 ml of starting buffer , centrifuged , resuspended in 2.5 ml of isotonic saline and tested for antibody activity . </s>
<s> During the latter procedure the temperature was maintained at 2-degrees-C by surrounding the apparatus with ice . </s>
<s> Because negative pressure dialysis gave better recovery of proteins , permitted detection of proteins concentrated from very dilute solutions and was a gentler procedure , it was used in all but the earliest experiments . </s>
<s> The unstained strips were then marked , using the stained ones as a guide , and cut transversely so as to separate the various protein bands . </s>
<s> These fractions were tested for ABO agglutinin activity , using fractions from group AB plasma as a control . </s>
<s> Chromatography of whole sera revealed that the areas of Rh antibody activity were generally continuous and wide . </s>
<s> The insoluble material resulting from dialysis against starting buffer always showed strong activity . </s>
<s> This was later known to be the result of concentrating the minute amount of complete antibody found in these sera ; ; </s>

<s> Still Andrena will do a reasonably good job , so that an animal with a full pollen load looks like a gay little piece of yellow down floating in the wind . </s>
<s> Certain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity , but it is impossible to know whether this is due to captive conditions . </s>
<s> It is possible to make a few generalizations about the six giants themselves . </s>
<s> For four of the six ( the anaconda and the amethystine python cannot be included for lack of data ) there is also a correlation between size at maturity and maximum length , the boa constrictor being the smallest and the Indian python the next in size at the former stage . </s>

<s> Lung type 3 ( ( fig. 3 ) is to some degree a composite of types 1 , and 2 . </s>
<s> This pleural supply is derived both from hilar and interlobular bronchial artery branches . </s>
<s> The diameter of this bronchial artery was much too large for it to be a mere vasa vasorum ( figs. 16 , 23 , 24 ) . </s>
<s> It is evident that many marked and striking differences exist between lungs when an inter-species comparison is made . </s>
<s> Also , interlobular air drifts may be all but nonexistent in the cow ; ; </s>
<s> However , this artery is known to be a nutrient vessel with a distribution primarily to the proximal airways and supportive tissues of the lung . </s>
<s> It is distinctly possible , therefore , that simultaneous pressures in all three vessels would have rendered the shunts inoperable and hence , uninjectable . </s>
<s> This viewpoint is further supported by Verloop's ( '48 ) demonstration of thickened bronchial artery and arteriolar muscular coats which are capable of acting as valves . </s>
<s> The main subgross anatomical features of the lungs of various mammals are presented . </s>
<s> The pleura is extremely thin in type 2 and septa are absent . </s>
<s> In type 3 the bronchial artery also provides blood directly to the alveolar capillary bed . </s>
<s> In type 1 the pulmonary vein closely follows the course of the bronchus and the pulmonary artery from the periphery to the hilum . </s>
<s> In type 3 , this general relationship is maintained peripherally but not centrally where the pulmonary vein follows a more independent path to the hilum as is the case throughout the lung in type 2 . </s>
<s> First , the Onset Profile spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls . </s>
<s> Although the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets . </s>
<s> When a dot appears close to the end of the transverse line , the `` moderate '' rating may be further classified according to the position of the dot with respect to the vertical marking denoting the mean age . </s>
<s> Such classifications may be called `` somewhat advanced '' or `` somewhat delayed '' , as the case may be , reserving `` moderate '' for dots upon or close to the mean . </s>
<s> Second , the upper portion permits comparison of maturity levels of an equal number of growth centers from the long , short , and round bones of the five regions . </s>
<s> The lower portion permits comparison of maturity levels of short and round bones predominantly , since only two long bones are included in Hand and Wrist as a region . </s>
<s> It is clear that there are some differences in the ratings , but there is substantial agreement . </s>
<s> This difference is readily clarified by referring to Table 1 . </s>
<s> For example , arrow 17 in Figure 3 portrays the proximal radial epiphysis for boy 34 , whereas the same epiphysis for girl 2 is portrayed by arrow 18 in Figure 4 . </s>
<s> The Skeletal Age curve in the lower portion of Figure 2 shows that slowing may have occurred for her during the prepubescent period . </s>
<s> The mean onset age was 25.3 months ( Table 1 ) , and the average Span of the osseous stage was 133 months . </s>
<s> It seems clear , from the counter-balanced shape of the series of arrows in Figure 5 that there was about an equal number of early and late Onsets and Completions for the 34 girls . </s>
<s> As an example of the interpretation of an arrow in the figure which exceeds four months in shaft length in conjunction with its position in the figure : girl 2 had a delayed Onset and further delayed Completion . </s>
<s> Boys 32 , 23 , 31 , 17 , 30 , 19 , and 24 had `` same schedule '' at Onset and Completion ; ; </s>
<s> thus early forecasting of the pubescent stage would appear possible for only seven boys . </s>

<s> Thyroglobulin synthesis </s>
<s> There is some reason to think that thyroglobulin synthesis may proceed independently of iodination , for in certain transplantable tumours of the rat thyroid containing essentially no iodinated thyroglobulin , a protein that appears to be thyroglobulin has been observed in ultracentrifuge experiments ( Wolff , Robbins and Rall , 1959 ) . </s>
<s> In addition , depending on availability of dietary iodine , thyroglobulin may contain varying quantities of iodine . </s>

<s> Besides proteolytic enzymes the thyroid possesses de-iodinating enzymes . </s>
<s> Antithyroid drugs </s>
<s> It is presumed to occur in other members of the Brassica family . </s>
<s> Here we shall restrict discussion to those methods that appear sufficiently sensitive and precise for determining the concentration of TSH in blood . </s>
<s> In evaluating data on the concentration of TSH in blood , one must examine critically the bio-assay methods used to obtain them . </s>
<s> The introduction of the United States Pharmacopoeia reference standard in 1952 and the redefinition and equating of the USP and international units of thyroid-stimulating activity have made it possible to compare results published by different investigators since that time . </s>

<s> In the first few experiments Af was passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and absorbed twice with 50 - 100 mg sweet clover tissue powder . </s>
<s> This specific fluorescence was readily distinguished from the light green nonspecific fluorescence in consecutive sections stained with 1 : 10 dilution of NS and Af or with Af alone . </s>
<s> Sections of crown gall tissue similarly stained with either Af and Af or NS and Af also showed only the light green nonspecific fluorescence . </s>
<s> Two absorptions of Af with ethyl acetate or two absorptions of Af ( which had been passed through Dowex-2-chloride ) , NS and Af with crown gall tissue powder , or mouse liver powder did not further improve the specificity of staining . </s>

<s> Moreover , the dominance in parasympathetic action ( with reciprocal inhibition of the sympathetic ) at the hypothalamic level induces , by its peripheral action , the autonomic symptoms of sleep and , by its action on the cortex , a lessening in the reactivity of the sensory and motor apparatus of the somatic nervous system . </s>

<s> The emotional states produced by drugs influence the cortical potentials in a characteristic manner ; ; </s>

<s> They shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side . </s>
<s> In both conditions the emotional and perceptual sensitivity is diminished , but no depression occurs such as is seen clinically or may be produced in normal persons by drugs . </s>
<s> The foregoing remarks imply that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial role at the crossroads between physiological and pathological forms of emotion . </s>

<s> What can we do with the general T ? ? </s>
<s> If we try to study T using characteristic values , we are confronted with two problems . </s>
<s> This is clearly a deficiency in T . </s>
<s> The characteristic polynomial for A is Af and this is plainly also the minimal polynomial for A ( or for T ) . </s>
<s> Thus the Af are projections which correspond to some direct-sum decomposition of the space V . </s>
<s> Conversely , suppose that **ya is in the null space of Af . </s>
<s> This shows that the minimal polynomial for Af divides Af . </s>
<s> Corollary . </s>
<s> Let N be a linear operator on the vector space V . </s>
<s> We say that N is nilpotent if there is some positive integer R such that Af . </s>
<s> Now suppose that we also have Af where D' is diagonalizable , N' is nilpotent , and Af . </s>
<s> hence they commute with D and with N . </s>
<s> Since N and N' are both nilpotent and they commute , the operator Af is nilpotent ; ; </s>
<s> ( Actually , a nilpotent operator on an n-dimensional space must have its T power 0 ; ; </s>
<s> but then since the operator is diagonalizable , the minimal polynomial cannot have a repeated root ; ; </s>
<s> It is a very interesting fact that these two problems can be handled simultaneously and this is what we shall do in the next chapter . </s>
<s> In concluding this section , we should like to give an example which illustrates some of the ideas of the primary decomposition theorem . </s>
<s> We have chosen to give it at the end of the section since it deals with differential equations and thus is not purely linear algebra . </s>

<s> More generally , suppose that an experiment consists of a number of independent trials , that each trial results in either a `` success '' or a `` non-success '' ( `` failure '' ) , and that the probability of success remains constant from trial to trial . </s>
<s> Or , what amounts to the same thing , if one die is tossed three times , each toss is a trial , and the three tosses form the experiment . </s>
<s> These examples are illustrative of the use of the words `` trial '' and `` experiment '' as they are used in this chapter , but they are quite flexible words and it is well not to restrict them too narrowly . </s>
<s> Student football managers . </s>
<s> Here the number of trials is a random variable , not a fixed number . </s>
<s> It is natural from the marksman's viewpoint to call a bull's-eye a success , but in the mice example it is arbitrary which category corresponds to straight hair in a mouse . </s>
<s> Each die has probability Af of producing an ace ; ; </s>
<s> We want to know the number of people going to the mountains . </s>
<s> When this experiment is viewed as composed of five binomial trials , one for each member of the family , the outcomes of the trials are obviously not independent . </s>
<s> Indeed , the experiment is better viewed as consisting of one binomial trial for the entire family . </s>
<s> Each performance of an n-trial binomial experiment results in some whole number from 0 through N as the value of the random variable X , where Af . </s>
<s> Thus we do not score the number of bull's-eyes , and the random variable is not the number of successes . </s>
<s> To summarize : </s>
<s> When each number of successes X is paired with its probability of occurrence Af , the set of pairs Af , is a probability function called a binomial distribution . </s>
<s> The set of all binomial distributions is called the family of binomial distributions , but in general discussions this expression is often shortened to `` the binomial distribution '' , or even `` the binomial '' when the context is clear . </s>
<s> The number of successes on each shot is a value of a random variable that has values 0 or 1 , and there are 5 such random variables here . </s>
<s> Consider a simple , closed , plane curve C which is a real-analytic image of the unit circle , and which is given by Af . </s>
<s> These are real analytic periodic functions with period T . </s>
<s> This theorem is similar to the theorem of Kakutani that there exists a circumscribing cube around any closed , bounded convex set in Af . </s>
<s> A square inscribed in a curve C means a square with its four corner points on the curve , though it may not lie entirely in the interior of C . </s>
<s> Indeed , the spiral Af , with the two endpoints connected by a straight line possesses only one inscribed square . </s>
<s> For any such square the middle corner of these will be called the vertex of the square and the corner not on the curve will be called the diagonal point of the square . </s>
<s> There are two types of such intersections , depending essentially on whether the curves cross at the point of intersection . </s>
<s> In the f-plane the coordinates of the corresponding point are Af . </s>
<s> The arc is itself a segment of an analytic curve . </s>
<s> ( B ) Af moves away from C and does not intersect it at all for Af ; ; </s>
<s> In the third category the function is double-valued in this interval . </s>
<s> The same remarks apply to an interval on the other side of Af . </s>
<s> Definition . </s>
<s> We suppose not . </s>
<s> But this is a contradiction , for we know that the multiplicity of f{t} is odd for every T . </s>
<s> The roots of this equation are just the ordinates of the intersections of the graph of B with a straight line of unit slope through Af in the b-plane ( the plane of the graph of b ) . </s>
<s> Let Q be a nonsingular quadric surface bearing reguli Af and Af , and let **zg be a Af curve of order K on Q . </s>
<s> We observe first that no line , l , can meet its image except at one of its intersections with Q . </s>
<s> The congruence of its secants is therefore of order Af and class Af . </s>
<s> Therefore , the congruence of its secants , that is the image of a general plane field of lines , is of order Af and class Af . </s>
<s> By ( 1 ) , the image of this pencil is a ruled surface of order Af which is met by the plane of the pencil in a curve , C , of order Af . </s>
<s> Hence it follows that the involution within the bundle must be a perspective De Jonquieres involution of order Af and the invariant locus must have a multiple line of multiplicity either Af or Af . </s>
<s> The multiple secants , of course , are exceptional and in each case are transformed into cones of order Af . </s>
<s> We now observe that the case in which **zg is a Af curve on a quadric is impossible if the complex of singular lines consists exclusively of the lines which meet Aj . </s>
<s> However , if there is no additional complex of singular lines , the order of the image regulus of a pencil is precisely Af . </s>
<s> As the historic processes of modernization gradually gain momentum , their cohesion will be threatened by divisive forces , the gaps between rulers and subjects , town and country , will widen ; ; </s>
<s> When we look at countries like Iran , Iraq , Pakistan , and Burma , where substantial progress has been made in creating a minimum supply of modern men and of social overhead capital , and where institutions of centralized government exist , we find a second category of countries with a different set of problems and hence different priorities for policy . </s>
<s> For example , in accordance with the fashion of the times , most transitional societies have announced economic development plans of varying numbers of years ; ; </s>
<s> But these countries have made big strides toward developing the necessary human and social overhead capital ; ; </s>
<s> This is the stage at which democratic developments must take place if the society is to become an open community of creative people . </s>
<s> It should attempt to communicate both an appreciation of professional standards and an understanding of the tremendous powers and potentialities of genuinely open and pluralistic societies . </s>
<s> but basically that pace depends on changes in the supply of resources and in the human attitudes , political institutions , and social structure which each society must generate . </s>
<s> The universe is a safe and permanent home . </s>
<s> A number of religions also satisfy for many the need of being linked with the ultimate and eternal . </s>
<s> Religion at its best also offers the experience of spiritual fulfillment by inviting man into the highest realm of the spirit . </s>
<s> The tensions accompanying a repressive consciousness of wrongdoing or sinning or some tormenting secret are relieved for the less self-contained or self-sufficient by confession , repentance , and penance . </s>
<s> Religion is vitally necessary in both societal maintenance and regulation . </s>
<s> Furthermore , religion tends to integrate the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of God to the intermediary and subordinate values ; ; </s>
<s> for example , marriage as a sacrament , much law-breaking as sinful , occasionally the state as a divine instrument . </s>
<s> Closely related to this function is the fact that the religious system provides a body of ultimate ends for the society , which are compatible with the supreme eternal ends . </s>
<s> These groups have varied widely from mere families , primitive , totemic groups , and small modern cults and sects , to the memberships of great denominations , and great , widely dispersed world religions . </s>
<s> The common codes , for religious action as such and in their ethical aspects for everyday moral behavior , bind the devotees together . </s>
<s> Durkheim noted long ago that religion as `` a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things unites into one single moral community all those who adhere to them '' . </s>
<s> It might be pointed out that the integrating function of religion , for good or ill , has often supported or been identified with other groupings -- political , nationality , language , class , racial , sociability , even economic . </s>
<s> It tends to support the longstanding precious sentiments , the traditional ways of thinking , and the customary ways of living . </s>
<s> Religion provides the most attractive rewards , either in this world or the next , for those who not merely abide by its norms , but who engage in good works . </s>
<s> Direct confrontation and acceptance of Mrs. B.'s anger against the second baby soon dissipated her fears of annihilation . </s>
<s> Though there is obviously nothing new about these techniques , they do challenge the worker's skill to articulate them precisely on the spot and on the basis of quick and accurate diagnostic assessments . </s>
<s> We should first recognize our tendency to develop a hierarchy of values , locating brief treatment at the bottom and long-term intensive service at the top , instead of seeing the services as part of a continuum , each important in its own right . </s>
<s> Thus , casework involving a limited number of interviews is still to be regarded in terms of the quality of service rendered rather than of the quantity of time expended . </s>
<s> In some programs , treatment is concentrated over a short period of time , while in others , after the initial contact is established , flexible spacing of interviews has been experimentally used with apparent success . </s>
<s> Further research in the meaning of crises as experienced by the consumers of traditional social casework services -- including attempts to develop a typology of family structures , crisis problems , reaction mechanisms , and differential treatment approaches -- and the establishment of new experimental programs are imperative social needs which should command the best efforts of caseworkers in collaboration with community planners . </s>
<s> Our literature is already replete with a fantastic number of suggestions for preventive agency programming ranging from the immediately practical to the globally utopian . </s>
<s> For example , child welfare experience abounds with cases in which the parental request for substitute care is precipitated by a crisis event which is meaningfully linked with a fundamental unresolved problem of family relationships . </s>
<s> The process of evaluation assigns varying positive and negative priorities or values to elements . </s>
<s> Regulative norms governing subgroups and roles . </s>

<s> Additionally , the proscription of core - Negro marriages for core families , discussed above , would seem to act as a regulative norm governing subgroups and roles . </s>
<s> The four functional problems of a social system are , to some extent , solved by the subsystems within this population . </s>
<s> To maintain their intermediate position in the larger society , it is not only necessary that members of this population be `` visible '' , but that their numbers be great enough to be recognized as a separate , distinct grouping or system in society . </s>
<s> The values placed by the Brandywine population , upon maintaining a certain homogeneity , a certain separate racial identity , and therefore a certain separate social status , are important for the morale of the system . </s>

<s> In 1922 a continuous registration of the whole indigenous population was instituted by ordinance of the Governor-General , and the periodic compilation of these records was ordered . </s>
<s> The district officials , along with their other duties , were obliged to organize special demographic inquiries in selected areas and to supervise the annual tabulations of demographic statistics . </s>

<s> A massive investigation of the characteristics of in-migrants and prospective out-migrants in Ruanda-Urundi is being carried on by J. J. Maquet , former Director of the Social Science branch of IRSAC , now a professor at l'Universite Officielle Du Congo Belge et Du Ruanda-Urundi . </s>
<s> Eventually responsibility for demographic inquiries in the Congo was transferred to the demographic division of the Central Statistical Office . </s>
<s> Sample areas in the new investigations were selected strictly by application of the principles of probability theory , so as to be representative of the total population of defined areas within calculable limits . </s>
<s> About 11 percent of the total population was covered in the new investigation , as compared with about 3 percent in the previous inquiries . </s>
<s> In the reports , summary results are given for both the de facto ( A and C ) and de jure ( A and B ) populations ; ; </s>
<s> Even though the registers may have an incomplete record of persons present in a particular area or include persons no longer living there , they contain precise information on ages , by date of birth , for some of the persons present ( especially children in relatively stable communities ) and supplementary information ( such as records of marital status ) for many others . </s>

<s> As one of them expressed it , `` It has done me a world of good to listen to the naive questions and comments of these not-yet-married people . </s>
<s> Thus , the writer decided to hold one experimental section of the functional preparation for marriage course in the spring semester of 1960 exclusively for persons already married -- that is , prerequisite : `` marriage '' . </s>
<s> This did not mean that married students could not enroll in other `` mixed '' sections , and some of them , largely because of scheduling difficulties , did . </s>
<s> This has subsequently been verified by the experience . </s>
<s> In the regular sections they have always been more or less discouraged . </s>
<s> Besides , auditors do not count on faculty load with the same weight as regularly enrolled students . </s>
<s> Many of the men on our campus have a pretty set curriculum , especially in the various engineering fields , with few electives till the senior year . </s>
<s> The writer never knew from week to week just where the section might be . </s>
<s> Though it did not become known to the writer for some time , a nucleus group had sprung up within the class . </s>
<s> Also , although only a few of the students were intimately acquainted with each other in the beginning , most reported that when the semester ended their dearest and closest campus friendships were with members of that class . </s>
<s> Supplemental outside reading reports were handled just as in the other sections , the major difference being that there was a noticeably deeper level in the reported outside reading by the married group . </s>
<s> This was not a search for a `` magic formula '' , but rather an examination of basic principles pertaining especially to all types of communication in marriage . </s>
<s> This added a personal zest to class discussions and participation . </s>
<s> Thus it is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief `` structuring '' experience . </s>
<s> Individual differences in Kohnstamm reactivity to controlled Kohnstamm situations were found among the subjects used in the study . </s>
<s> There were 49% ( 20 subjects ) who did not give a positive reaction even after they were informed of the normalcy of such a reaction and had been given a demonstration . </s>
<s> This information was accepted with the frequent interpretation that those persons who did not show arm-levitation must be preventing it . </s>
<s> The positive Kohnstamm reactivity in Condition 1 ( ( the naive state ) is not adequately explained by such a concept as suggestibility ( if suggestibility is defined as the influence on behavior by verbal cues ) . </s>
<s> A suggestion Hypothesis also seems inadequate as an explanation for those who shifted their reactions after they were informed of the possibilities of `` normal '' reactions different from those which they gave . </s>
<s> They explained its absence in others on the basis of an intervention of control factors . </s>
<s> Another said that her arm did not go up at first `` because I wouldn't let it ; ; </s>
<s> Thus , this readiness to relax controls , evidenced in the Kohnstamm situation , appears to be a more general personality factor . </s>

<s> Rating scale of compulsivity </s>
<s> An interview schedule of open-ended questions and a multiple-choice questionnaire were prepared , and one parent of each of the sample children was seen in the home . </s>

<s> Tables 1 and 2 present the results of the statistical analysis of the data when compulsivity is used as the descriptive variable . </s>
<s> Figure 1 portrays the mean achievement scores of each sub-group graphically . </s>
<s> It is interesting to note that medium compulsives in the unstructured schools made the lowest achievement scores ( although not significantly lower ) . </s>
<s> Our conjecture is , then , that regardless of the manner in which school lessons are taught , the compulsive child accentuates those elements of each lesson that aid him in systematizing his work . </s>
<s> The interaction effect , which is significant at the level , can be seen best in the contrast of mean scores . </s>
<s> Success reduces the prospect of threat and his powers of discrimination are improved . </s>
<s> Although the present study was not a direct replication of their investigations , the results do not confirm their conclusion . </s>

<s> Despite the fact that he was regarded as an outstanding engineer , he seemed to be a very poor administrator , although no one quite knew what was wrong with him . </s>
<s> However , in this case the district manager was led to see the errors of his ways . </s>
<s> The necessary step between diagnosis and training is acceptance of the validity of the criticisms . </s>
<s> Eighteen errors were located , and then the director asked each individual to vote whether or not they felt that this manager had made the particular errors . </s>
<s> and `` cannot say '' if they were not certain . </s>
<s> The manager sat behind the group so he could see and count the hands that went up , and the director wrote the numbers on the blackboard . </s>

<s> It then occurred to me to ask , `` Is that what that woman told you '' ? ? </s>

<s> The many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary's contents around prefixes , stems , suffixes , etc. . </s>
<s> dictionary information about the form stored at this location can be retrieved directly by occurrences of the form in text . </s>
<s> Text lookup , as we will describe it , consists of three steps . </s>
<s> When this situation exists , the address Af will equal Af which was produced from Af . </s>
<s> If Af was assigned as the information cell for Af , the routine can detect that Af is identical to Af by comparing Af with the form stored at location Af . </s>
<s> A third cell can be added by storing the address of another Y-cell in Af ; ; </s>
<s> the absence of such a link in the last cell indicates the end of the chain . </s>
<s> The dictionary form is compared with each of these text forms . </s>
<s> When a match is found , an entry is made in the table of dictionary usage . </s>
<s> A description of this process will serve to illustrate how any type of information can be retrieved from the dictionary and attached to each text occurrence . </s>
<s> When entries are being retrieved from this file , the table of dictionary usage indicates which entries to skip and which entries to store in the computer . </s>
<s> This selection-rejection process takes place as the file is read . </s>
<s> Each entry that is selected for storage is written into the next available cells of the Aj . </s>
<s> Hence , the description of each text occurrence can be retrieved by reading the list of text-ordered information-cell addresses and outputting the description indicated by the information cell for each occurrence . </s>
<s> The only requirements on dictionary information made by the text-lookup operation are that each form represented by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text-form list and that information for each form be available in a sequence identical with the sequence of the forms . </s>

<s> Dominant stress on pretty would be almost insulting here . </s>
<s> In the written language then can be underlined or italicized to guide the reader here , but much of the time the written language simply depends on the reader's alertness , and a careless reader will have to back up and reread . </s>
<s> Often , dominant stress simply indicates a centering of attention or emotion . </s>
<s> In is she Chinese or Japanese ? ? </s>
<s> Here again , in the written language it is possible to help the reader get his stresses right by using underlining or italics , but much of the time there is simply reliance on his understanding in the light of context . </s>

<s> Phonemes connected by a morphophonemic rule commonly show a good bit of phonetic similarity , possible because of the several dimensions of contrast in the system . </s>

<s> The statement of the system is a different matter . </s>
<s> Linguists have not always been more enlightened than `` practical people '' and sometimes have insisted on incredibly trivial points while neglecting things of much greater significance . </s>
<s> The paper has a certain value as a comparatively easy introduction to this approach , particularly since it treats a fairly simple and straightforward phenomenon where it is possible to compare it with a more traditional ( though not structural ) statement . </s>

<s> It is the hope of attaining a list of items of universal occurrence . </s>

<s> Federal assistance is limited to half of the total expenditure , and the state or local districts must pay at least half . </s>
<s> Today , Federal funds account for only one-fifth of the nation's expenditures for vocational education . </s>
<s> During World War 2 , about 7.5 million persons were enrolled in courses organized under two special programs administered by state and local school authorities : ( 1 ) Vocational Education for National Defense , and ( 2 ) War Production Training . </s>
<s> Most skilled industrial workers , nevertheless , still acquire their skills outside of formal training institutions . </s>
<s> In Illinois about 13 per cent of the schools have programs , and in Pennsylvania 11 per cent . </s>
<s> Few states make effective use of their existing vocational education programs or funds for the purpose of attracting new industry . </s>
<s> The opportunity exists for states to reserve some of their vocational education funds to apply on an ad hoc flexible basis to subsidize any local preemployment training programs that may be quickly set up in a community to aid a new industrial plant . </s>
<s> All the manuals for setting up vocational courses stress the importance of first making a local survey of skill needs , of estimating the growth of local jobs , and of consulting with local employers on the types of courses and their content . </s>
<s> Local jobs can be seen and counted , while opportunities elsewhere are regarded as more hypothetical . </s>
<s> While the U. S. Department of Labor has a program of projecting industry and occupational employment trends and publishing current outlook statements , there is little tangible evidence that these projections have been used extensively in local curriculum planning . </s>
<s> Elaborate studies have been made in labor surplus areas in order to identify sufficient numbers of local job vacancies and future replacement needs for certain skills to justify training programs for those skills . </s>
<s> There is little evidence that existing public or private training programs have any great difficulty getting students to enroll in their programs , even though they must pay tuition , receive no subsistence payments , and are not guaranteed a job . </s>
<s> Again , one major difficulty is the local focus . </s>
<s> Only the Federal government is likely to be able to take a long-run and nation-wide view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower needs . </s>
<s> A further possibility is suggested by the example of the G. I. bills and also by some recent trends in attitudes toward improving college education : that is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate . </s>

<s> The purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which has not been treated in the literature , but which we believe makes a significant contribution to explaining the wage-price behavior of a few very important industries . </s>
<s> For expository purposes , this is best treated as a model which spells out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence of union pressures for higher wages . </s>
<s> 1 , the assumptions of the model </s>
<s> B . </s>
<s> The manner in which this is shared among firms is taken as given . </s>
<s> For the purposes of this discussion , the problem of relative prices is encompassed in these two variables , since GNP includes other prices . </s>
<s> Industry product price policy </s>
<s> Because of its importance , and because the lack of price competition is well recognized , the industry is under considerable public pressure not to raise its price any more than could be justified by cost increases . </s>
<s> The threat of effective anti-trust action , provoked by `` gouging the public '' through price increases not justified by cost increases , and fears of endangering relations with customers , Congress , the general public and the press , all operate to keep price increases in some relation to cost increases . </s>
<s> In such circumstances , it may well be to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage rate . </s>
<s> We are abstracting from the fact of strikes here , but it should be obvious that the extent to which the public-limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put up by the industry . </s>
<s> Thus , the public-limit price is raised further by a given wage increase the longer it has been since the previous price increase . </s>
<s> This is not extended to anticipated levels of GNP , however -- only the current level of GNP affects the public pressure against wage-price increases . </s>
<s> The union does not regard unemployment of its own members as a matter of concern when setting its own wage policy -- its concern with employment makes itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain full employment . </s>
<s> The union vigorously demands wage increases from productivity increases , and wage increases to offset cost-of-living increases , but we abstract from these forces here . </s>
<s> Disagreement on the amount of productivity increase exacerbates the problem of agreeing how an increase in profit margins related to a productivity increase should be shared . </s>
<s> Hall , for example , was quite explicit on this point when he said states outside European civilization must formally enter into the circle of law-governed countries . </s>
<s> A state , the highest form of human organization in fact and theory , could be subjected to Law only by a manifestation of self-will , or consent . </s>
<s> There was no law , domestic or international , except that willed by , acknowledged by , or consented to by states . </s>
<s> Particularly was this true when the norms previously applied were no longer satisfactory to many , when customs were rapidly changing as the forces of the new productivity were harnessed . </s>
<s> The old way of doing things , which depended on a relatively stable community with stable ideas dealing with familiar situations , was no longer adequate to the task . </s>

<s> ) Here again Mr. Justice Frankfurter could not lightly accept the principle of wholesale judicial legislation . </s>
<s> Does Lincoln Mills suggest that if Congress granted jurisdiction over interstate divorce cases , the federal courts would be authorized to fashion a national law for the dissolution of marriages ? ? </s>
<s> A careful student has suggested that `` In any new revision ( of the Judicial Code ) the legislators would do well to remember that the allocation of power to the federal courts should be limited to those matters in which their expertise in federal law might be used , leaving to the state judiciaries the primary obligation of pronouncing state law '' . </s>
<s> Federal review of state decisions </s>
<s> To insure uniformity in the meaning of national law , however , state interpretations are subject to Supreme Court review . </s>
<s> The result , of course , would be that federal law inevitably would mean different things in different states . </s>

<s> These items , and most of the others listed above , seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section 381 . </s>

<s> A clearly recognized exception is a statutory merger or consolidation . </s>
<s> The leading case , Seaboard Air Line Railway v. United States , held that the transferee could sue for a refund of taxes paid by the transferor , and it has been consistently followed . </s>
<s> Exceptions are often classified as transfers by `` operation of law '' . </s>
<s> A recent case in point is Mitchell Canneries v. United States , in which a claim against the Government was transferred first from a corporation to a partnership , whose partners were former stockholders , and then to another corporation formed by the partners . </s>
<s> Holding the final corporation entitled to sue on the claim , the Court cited the Seaboard , Novo Trading , and Roomberg cases for the proposition that `` transfers by operation of law or in conjunction with changes of corporate structure are not assignments prohibited by the statute '' . </s>
<s> In an earlier case , Kingan & Co. v. United States , an American corporation was formed for the purpose of acquiring the stock of a British corporation in exchange for its own stock and then liquidating the British corporation . </s>
<s> The transaction presumably would have qualified under section 368(a)(1) as a contractual reorganization , followed by a section 332 liquidation , but not under section 368(a)(1) as a statutory merger of consolidation . </s>
<s> In substance , said the Court , there was no transfer of equitable title . </s>

<s> These results appear sound . </s>
<s> There are certain tax attributes of a corporation whose nature and effect might depend on the facts of the particular reorganization involved . </s>

<s> Children differ widely in their emotional responses . </s>
<s> The following summary will give the student some idea about the social characteristics of elementary-school children ; ; </s>
<s> During early childhood , children are more interested in the approval of their parents and teachers than they are in the approval of other children ; ; </s>
<s> such factors as sex , intelligence , and status in the group do not influence his choice much at this time . </s>
<s> those who feel inferior or insecure engage in these activities more than do well-adjusted children . </s>
<s> However , as we have seen , in later childhood the child begins to substitute the standards of the peer group for those of parents and teachers . </s>
<s> Studies conducted in various sections of the United States indicate that many children in elementary schools are maladjusted emotionally , and that many of them are failing to make satisfactory progress in school subjects . </s>
<s> They may be caused by poor health habits , such as faulty eating and sleeping habits . </s>

<s> The Middle-South Region , as defined by the National Association of Intergroup Relations Officials ( NAIRO ) , consists of the states of Kentucky , Maryland , Tennessee , West Virginia , Delaware , Virginia and the District of Columbia . </s>
<s> In West Virginia the number of white and Negro children attending the same school has increased almost twofold . </s>
<s> As a result of the State Board of Education plan , Negro children entered heretofore white elementary schools in five districts . </s>
<s> As a school district , the District of Columbia has had desegregated schools since 1954 , shortly after the Supreme Court decision . </s>

<s> This is the Powell Amendment , which in 1957 divided even a `` liberal '' group like the American Veterans Committee ( AVC ) . </s>
<s> If people don't want to provide public education , should they be forced to do so ? ? </s>
<s> We actually have two issues in this question -- goal and method . </s>
<s> Teachers who have been upward mobile probably see education as most valuable for their students if it serves students as it has served them ; ; </s>
<s> There are several causes for this , one being rapid economic development with increasing numbers of of middle-class positions requiring engineering or scientific training . </s>
<s> Another public interest group is the commission of laymen or educators which is appointed to study an educational problem and to make recommendations . </s>
<s> Generally these commissions work earnestly to represent the interest of the entire society , as they conceive it . </s>
<s> Furthermore , the Commission set up the Council for Financial Aid to Education as a means of encouraging private business to increase its support of private higher education . </s>
<s> But there is very little frank and conscious espousal of the interests of any one social class by the people who have the power to make decisions in education . </s>
<s> One such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs . </s>
<s> Here , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma . </s>
<s> For more explicit expositions , one must distinguish different types of analyses . </s>
<s> Thus , during any given year ( A ) if the revenues from the residential service are $7,000,000 , ( B ) if the operating expenses imputed to this class of service come to $5,000,000 , and ( C ) if the net investment in ( or value of ) the plant and equipment deemed devoted to this service amounts to $30,000,000 , the cost analyst will report that residential service , in the aggregate , has yielded a return of $2,000,000 or 6-2/3 per cent . </s>
<s> In order to simplify the exposition of a typical fully apportioned cost analysis , let us assume the application of the analysis to an electric utility company supplying a single city with power generated by its own steam-generation plant . </s>
<s> This latter assumption will permit us to center attention on the most controversial aspect of modern public utility cost analysis -- the distinction among costs that are functions of outputs of the same service measured along different dimensions . </s>

<s> The pain of the rabbit was not itself bad ; ; </s>
<s> badness , in the only sense in which it is involved at all , waited for its appearance till I came and looked and felt . </s>
<s> It removes our present expression and shows that the badness we meant would not be affected by this , whereas on positivist grounds it should be . </s>
<s> I come now to a third argument , which again is very simple . </s>
<s> In these circumstances , since what was expressed by the remark when first made is , on the theory before us , simply absent , the remark now expresses nothing . </s>
<s> My point is this : whether there is such fitness or not , we all assume that there is , and if we do , we express in moral judgments more than the subjectivists say we do . </s>

<s> But anybody who promises a substantial volume of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these days , and many businesses can live without the railroad . </s>
<s> And there are now many millions of workers for whom the factory with the big parking lot , which can be reached by driving across or against the usual pattern of rush hour traffic and grille-route bus lines , is actually more convenient than the walk-to factory . </s>
<s> In spreading the factories even farther , the automobile may not have changed to any great extent the growth pattern of the cities . </s>
<s> Even the loss of hotel business to the outskirt's motel has been relatively painless ; ; </s>
<s> If the retailer and hotelman's downtown unit sales have been decreasing , however , his dollar volume continues to rise , and it is dollars which you put in the bank . </s>
<s> Accounting procedures which continue to charge a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store make the branches seem more profitable than they are . </s>
<s> If anything may be predicted in the quicksilver world of retailing , it seems likely that the suburban branch will come to dominate children's clothing ( taking the kid downtown is too much of a production ) , household gadgetry and the discount business in big-ticket items . </s>

<s> What follows is therefore a description of three separate undertakings , the new frescoing of the gap , and the successive essays in conservation , with some discussion of problems that arose in connection with each . </s>
<s> For the use of students and future restorers , a full , day-by-day record was kept of all three undertakings , complete technical reports on what we found and what we did . </s>
<s> The first preliminary was inspecting the unfinished length of frieze , a jumble of roughcast and finish coats , all in bad condition . </s>
<s> Moreover , all three representations must be squeezed comfortably into little more than the length Brumidi allowed for each one of his . </s>
<s> When it was all arranged to fit , and not to interrupt the lengthwise flow of movement in the frieze , the cartoons were tried in place . </s>
<s> The scaffolding , a confusion of heavy beams hanging from the gallery above , was strong and safe , but obscured visibility . </s>
<s> That is , they used opaque color throughout , getting solid highlights with active lime white . </s>
<s> The use of `` secco '' we tried to restrict to covering joints . </s>
<s> On the right is the Brumidi Liberty group , as it looked after cleaning operations , which had not yet come around to the other end ; ; </s>
<s> The plaster was sound , the intonaco firmly attached all over , and the pigment solidly incorporated with it in all but a few unimportant places . </s>
<s> These frescos have had no care for eighty years . </s>
<s> With naked gas jets below and leaky windows above , enough to ruin wall paintings in any medium , they have survived , in a building long unheated in winter , hot and damp under the iron dome in summer . </s>
<s> Too much damage is done by `` experts '' who have spent even less time , if any at all , in the U.S.S.R. . </s>
<s> If this attitude is seriously questioned in the Soviet Union , it does not necessarily follow that the majority of the society in which I live is too aware of the necessity for clarity on this ethical as well as aesthetic point of view . </s>
<s> Personal predispositions tend to blunt the ear and , in turn , the voice as well . </s>
<s> Difficult as it may have been at times , Pozzatti and I saw enough , talked to enough artists , historians and others to realize that the issue is quite clear . </s>
<s> The grave , about half-way between his home and the blue turrets of a small church , rose above the forms and spaces of gently undisciplined pastures of green , the sounds of birds , the silence of other graves and the casual paths through small forests . </s>
<s> One had taken a flight into uncharted space , in the service of science , to return as a living hero . </s>
<s> The other had assumed the right to explore the equally uncharted space of the human spirit . </s>
<s> Theories of the behavior pattern of population masses were compared to scientific discoveries concerning the motion-pattern of gaseous masses . </s>
<s> Typical of such an experience was the occasion of a somewhat formal official welcome in the offices of the Union of Soviet Artists . </s>
<s> We had looked forward to what we hoped to be our first informal meeting with a number of Moscow's artists . </s>
<s> To save time , some clarification seemed necessary . </s>
<s> Your past history is resplendent with the fruits of the intellect . </s>
<s> A work so broad , even when it is directed by a leading idea and informed by a moral vision , must necessarily `` fail '' . </s>
<s> It would come down to saying that Fromm paints with a broad brush , and that , after all , is not a conclusion one must work toward but an impression he has from the outset . </s>
<s> Since I have already discussed his moral position , that discussion is incorporated by reference into the following pages , which will focus on the empirical and analytic side of Fromm's treatment . </s>
<s> The idea has received much attention in philosophy , in literature , and in a few works of general social criticism , such as The Sane Society . </s>
<s> Taking alienation as a dependent variable , with what socio-structural factors is it most highly associated ? ? </s>
<s> I am not suggesting that Fromm ought to do this kind of work . </s>
<s> Nor do I think that alienation is nothing more than a projection of the malaise of the intellectual . </s>
<s> There is nothing remarkable about this at all . </s>
<s> Furthermore , the list is interesting for its omissions . </s>
<s> Of course , the list also excludes all writers who are fairly `` optimistic '' about the modern situation ; ; </s>
<s> It is of course useful to have a sovereign cause on one's social criticism , for it makes diagnosis and prescription much easier than they might otherwise be . </s>
<s> Otherwise Mussorgsky reserves his vocal melodies for prolonged expressions of emotion -- Boris' first monologue , for example . </s>
<s> Even then , the flexibility of the phrasing suggests that the word comes first in importance . </s>
<s> Under no circumstances could we mistake one for the other ; ; </s>
<s> A quiet but sturdy theme , somewhat folklike in character , appears whenever the old monk speaks of the history he is recording or of his own past life : </s>
<s> An imaginative storyteller , Pimen takes on the character he describes , as if he were experiencing the old shepherd's blindness and miraculous cure . </s>
<s> The original D minor seems to symbolize blindness , inescapable in spite of all attempts to move away from it . </s>
<s> A rough ostinato figure , heard first in the introduction to the inn scene , characterizes him amusingly and reappears whenever he comes into the action : </s>
<s> The Song Of Kazan , in which this figure becomes a wild-sounding accompaniment , fills in the picture of undisciplined high spirits . </s>
<s> He speaks quietly , concealing his authority beneath a smooth humility , just as the shifting harmonies that accompany him all but hide the firm pedal point beneath them . </s>
<s> Coming from a priest , the music sounds as odd as the advice : </s>
<s> we are reminded of this at the end of the next scene , when his theme cuts through the warmth of the love duet , again throwing a chill over the atmosphere . </s>
<s> This is the real protagonist of the drama ; ; </s>
<s> the conflict is not Boris versus Grigori or Shuiski or even the ghost of the murdered child , but Boris versus the Russian people . </s>
<s> Mussorgsky makes this quite clear by the extent to which choral scenes propel the action . </s>
<s> They will kneel and plead for Boris' leadership in a strangely intense song , its phrases irregularly broken as if gasping for breath , but when the police with their cudgels move away , they mock and grumble and fight among themselves . </s>
<s> And Mityukh , apparently the intellectual leader of the crowd , replies that he has no notion . </s>
<s> Mussorgsky frequently uses liturgical music with considerable dramatic force . </s>
<s> this final reminder of his guilt is the fatal one . </s>
<s> This seems odd when one recalls that he wrote poetry longer than any other major English poet : `` Domicilium '' is dated `` between 1857 and 1860 '' ; ; </s>
<s> And though in his later years he revised his poems many times , the revisions did not alter the essential nature of the style which he had established before he was thirty ; ; </s>
<s> There is only one Hardy style , but in the earlier poems that style is only intermittently evident , and when it is not , the style is the style of another poet , or of the fashion of the time . </s>
<s> In the later poems , however , the personal tone predominates . </s>
<s> the internal organization rarely has any chronological order , except in obvious groups like the `` Poems of Pilgrimage '' , the `` Poems of 1912 - 13 '' , and the war poems . </s>
<s> From the dated poems we can venture certain conclusions about Hardy's career in poetry , always remembering that conclusions based on a fraction of the whole must remain tentative . </s>
<s> The last three volumes are again more dependent on the past , as Hardy's creative powers declined in his old age . </s>
<s> These observations about Hardy's productivity tally with the details of his life as we know them . </s>
<s> The first productive period came when he was considering poetry as a vocation , before he had decided to write fiction for a living ( in his note for Who's Who he wrote that he `` wrote verses 1865 - 1868 ; ; </s>
<s> but resumed it later '' ) . </s>
<s> Like a wise gardener , Hardy pruned away the Shakespearian sonnets and songs , and the elements of meter and poetic diction to which his personal style was not suited , and let the main stock of his talent flourish . </s>
<s> We can see the general characteristics of the earlier decade if we look at two poems of very different qualities : `` Revulsion '' ( 1866 ) and `` Neutral Tones '' ( 1867 ) . </s>
<s> Almost anyone could have written it ; ; </s>
<s> it asserts emotion without evoking it -- that is to say , it is sentimental . </s>
<s> The poem does not distort the syntax of ordinary speech nor draw on exotic sources of diction , yet it is obviously not ordinary speech -- only Hardy would say `` a grin of bitterness swept thereby ; ; </s>
<s> In the 1860 - 70 decade there are many poems like `` Revulsion '' , but there is only one `` Neutral Tones '' . </s>
<s> the fire of love is dead , and Hardy stands , as the speaker does in the last poem of the sequence , over the burnt circle of charred sticks , and thinks of past happiness and present grief , honest and uncomforted . </s>
<s> Critically invisible , modern revolt , like X-rays and radioactivity , is perceived only by its effects at more materialistic social levels , where it is called delinquency . </s>
<s> The rowdy crowd chilled into stillness and the fluent melody spiraled through it . </s>
<s> It had assumed the terrifying inertia of inanimate matter . </s>
<s> Art may have been for him the most enduring , orderly , and noble activity of man . </s>
<s> But the other activities of his life partook of these values . </s>
<s> Thomas is a regression from the technical originality and ingenuity of writers like Pierre Reverdy or Apollinaire . </s>
<s> It is true of the rhythmic pattern in which the beat shifts continuously , or at least is continuously sprung , so that it becomes ambiguous enough to allow the pattern to be dominated by the long pulsations of the phrase or strophe . </s>
<s> The metaphysical conceits , which fascinate the Reactionary Generation still dominant in backwater American colleges , were embroideries . </s>
<s> The immediate theme , if it exists , is incidental , and his main theme -- the terror of birth -- is simply reiterated . </s>
<s> The insistent talk-aboutiveness of the general environment obtrudes into even the most idyllic poetry . </s>
<s> Technique pure and simple , rendition , is not of major importance , but it is interesting that Parker , following Lester Young , was one of the leaders of the so-called saxophone revolution . </s>
<s> A poem by Dylan Thomas , a saxophone solo by Charles Parker , a painting by Jackson Pollock -- these are pure confabulations as ends in themselves . </s>
<s> Uninhibited lyricism should be distinguished from its exact opposite -- the sterile , extraneous invention of the corn-belt metaphysicals , or present blight of poetic professors . </s>
<s> In fact , his only disciple -- the only person to imitate his style -- was W. S. Graham , who seems to have imitated him without much understanding , and who has since moved on to other methods . </s>
<s> The point is that many of the most impressive developments in the arts nowadays are aberrant , idiosyncratic . </s>
<s> In the plastic arts , a very similar situation exists . </s>
<s> The aesthetic appeal of pure paint laid on at random may exist , but it is a very impoverished appeal . </s>
<s> A Tiepolo painting , however confabulated , is a universe of tensions in vast depths . </s>
<s> In fact , once the size is big enough to cover a whole wall , it turns into nothing more than extremely expensive wallpaper . </s>
<s> The great Ashikaga brush painters painted wallpapers , too -- at least portable ones , screens . </s>
<s> Alcinous' court bard sings of the discovered adultery of Ares and Aphrodite ( Odyssey 8 266-366 ) , and takes up a tale of Odysseus while the Ithacan wanderer listens on ( Odyssey 8 499-520 ) . </s>
<s> Nothing in all this is autobiographical : unlike the poets of Deor and Widsith , the poet of Beowulf is not concerned with his own identity ; ; </s>
<s> Proceeding from Parry's conclusions and adopting one of his schemata , Francis P. Magoun , Jr. , argues that Beowulf likewise was created from a legacy of oral formulas inherited and extended by bards of successive generations , and the thesis is striking and compelling . </s>
<s> Assonance seems nearly as severe a curb , although in a celebrated passage William of Malmesbury declares that A Song Of Roland was intoned before the battle commenced at Hastings . </s>
<s> Even though the bondage of his verse is not so great as the writing poet can manage , it is still great enough for him often to be seriously impeded unless he has aids to facilitate rapid composition . </s>
<s> The Germanic poet had such aids in the kennings , which provided for the difficulties of alliteration ; ; </s>
<s> Verbal and adverbial elements too participated in each epic diction , but it is for the present sufficient to mark the large nominal and adjectival supply of semantic near-equivalents , and to designate the members of any system of equivalents as basic formulas of the poetic language . </s>
<s> The quest of the historical Homer is likely never to have further success ; ; </s>
<s> no strikingly effective element of speech in the extant poems can with assurance be said not to have been a commonplace in the vaster epic corpus that may have existed at the beginning of the first millennium before Christ . </s>
<s> Yet they are written ; ; </s>
<s> Other theories of origin are compatible with the formulaic theory : Beowulf may contain a design for terror , and The Iliad may have a vast hysteron-proteron pattern answering to a ceramic pattern produced during the Geometric Period in pottery . </s>
<s> In determining the extent to which any poem is formulaic it is idle , however , to inspect nothing besides lines repeated in their entirety , for a stock of line-fragments would be sufficient to permit the poet to extemporize with deftness if they provided for prosodic needs . </s>
<s> In his analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative . </s>
<s> Miss Havisham's withered hands , heavy as if her unhappiness were somehow concentrated in them , move in restless self-pity between her broken heart and her walking stick . </s>
<s> Such associations suit well with the gothic or mystery-story aspects of Dickens' novel , but , on a deeper plane , they relate to the themes of sin , guilt , and pursuit that have recently been analyzed by other critics . </s>
<s> The novel opens with a fugitive convict frantically trying to avoid the nemesis of being `` laid hands on '' -- a mysterious figure who looks into Pip's frightened eyes in the churchyard `` as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people , stretching up cautiously out of their graves , to get a twist upon his ankle and pull him in '' . </s>
<s> Since they commonly translate thoughts and feelings into deeds , hands naturally represent action , and since nearly half the characters in Great Expectations are of the underworld or closely allied to it , the linking of hands with crime or violence is not to be wondered at . </s>
<s> Orlick slouches about the forge `` like Cain '' with `` his hands in his pockets '' , and when he shouts abuse at Mrs. Joe for objecting to his holiday , she claps her hands in a tantrum , beats them `` upon her bosom and upon her knees '' , and clenches them in her husband's hair . </s>
<s> But only in one of its aspects is Great Expectations a tale of violence , revenge , and retribution . </s>
<s> Pip imagines how Estella would look down upon Joe's hands , roughened by work in the smithy , and the deliberate contrast between her white hands and his blackened ones is made to symbolize the opposition of values between which Pip struggles -- idleness and work , artificiality and naturalness , gentility and commonness , coldness and affection -- in fact , between Satis House and the forge . </s>
<s> When the snobbery that alienates Pip from Joe finally gives way before the deeper and stronger force of love , the reunion is marked by an embarrassed handshake at which Pip exclaims : `` No , don't wipe it off -- for God's sake , give me your blackened hand '' ! ! </s>
<s> Pip's abject leave-taking of Miss Havisham , during which he kneels to kiss her hand , signalizes his homage to a supposed patroness who seems to be opening up for him a new world of glamour ; ; </s>
<s> when , on the journey to London that immediately follows , he pauses nostalgically to lay his hand upon the finger-post at the end of the village , the wooden pointer symbolically designates a spiritual frontier between innocence and the corruption of worldly vanity . </s>
<s> In both cases the finger-post represents Pip's heightened awareness of contrary magnetisms . </s>

<s> Research at Fayette , Missouri on oxidation ponds has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to 53 mg/l with loadings from 8 to 120 lb . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> The oxidation pond has a surface area of 4.77 acres and a depth of 4 Aj . </s>
<s> In the summer of 1960 the oxidation pond became completely septic and emitted obnoxious odors . </s>
<s> The pilot plant was a circular lagoon 81 ft in diam at the surface and 65 ft in diam at the bottom , 4 ft below the surface , with a volume of 121,000 Aj . </s>
<s> Initially , the wastewater would be entirely from the shopping center with the domestic sewage from the houses increasing over an 18-month period . </s>
<s> This operation would permit evaluation of the pilot plant , with a slowly increasing load , over a reasonable period of time . </s>
<s> The long retention period and the complete mixing concept prevented rapid changes in either the mixed liquor or in the effluent . </s>
<s> Grab samples were collected from the existing oxidation pond to determine its operating conditions . </s>
<s> It seems that the aerated lagoon was a very heavily loaded oxidation pond or a lightly loaded activated sludge system . </s>
<s> The retention period in the aerated lagoon ranged from 9.8 to 2.6 days , averaging 6.4 days . </s>
<s> Variations in aerator speeds during the latter two months of this study caused increased mixing and increased oxygen demand . </s>
<s> The increase in oxygen uptake rates from 1.2 to 2.6 mg/l/hr which followed an increase in rotor speed was believed to be related to resuspension of solids which had settled at the lower rotor speeds . </s>
<s> Routine determinations were made for dissolved oxygen in the mixed liquor and for oxygen uptake rates . </s>
<s> Oxidation pond </s>
<s> The daily sewage volume to the oxidation pond averaged 147,000 gpd , giving a retention period of 42 days . </s>
<s> The last category overlaps the others in amphibious operations and near terminals and bases . </s>
<s> Necessity for an over-all concept </s>
<s> While one element is announcing progress , another is delineating its problems . </s>
<s> The result , coupled with the salesmanship for which American industry is famous , is considerable expenditure of funds and efforts in marginal areas . </s>
<s> That which follows will be a discussion of principles and possible content for an over-all concept of antisubmarine warfare . </s>
<s> Logically , then , the first principle of the plan must be that it is not rigidly oriented toward any geographical area . </s>
<s> In transit or on station , it may not be possible to attack the submarines until commission of an overt act . </s>
<s> Its speed has increased , it operates at increasingly greater depths , its submerged endurance is becoming unlimited , and it will become even more silent . </s>
<s> Therefore , the fourth principle of the plan must be that it provide for continuously increasing capabilities in the opponent . </s>
<s> Before considering these elements in more detail , an additional requirement should be stated . </s>
<s> These can be referred to as operational intelligence and environmental intelligence . </s>
<s> Environmental intelligence is just as important . </s>
<s> Therefore , improved intelligence will result in reduced force requirements and , as it supports all other elements , rates a top priority . </s>
<s> All capabilities must be used to maximum advantage then . </s>
<s> These variations must eventually be measured horizontally as well as vertically . </s>
<s> A concurrent effort is needed to make oceanographic data useful on the spot . </s>
<s> For example , effective mine barriers from Florida to Cuba and across the Yucatan Channel from Cuba to Mexico would remove all requirements for harbor defense , inshore patrol , convoy escort , shipping control , and mine defense for the entire Gulf of Mexico . </s>
<s> Systems covering the Gulf of St. Lawrence and possibly the entire coasts of the United States are not impossible . </s>
<s> Fixed installations will always lack the flexibility that should be inherent in naval systems . </s>
<s> The submarine has become increasingly attractive as an antisubmarine weapon system . </s>
<s> chemical studies are being pursued with the cooperation of K.G. Untch . </s>
<s> Various metal ions have been found to protect plasma arylesterase against inactivation by urea and guanidine . </s>
<s> The non-identity of serum and red blood cell arylesterase was also established . </s>
<s> The silicate fractions of stony meteorites show gallium / germanium ratios similar to those of tektites because they too have undergone melting at some point in their histories . </s>
<s> The structures , properties , and reactions of these compounds are being studied . </s>

<s> Only uninterrupted sequences of the former are eligible for formation of crystallites . </s>
<s> The complex morphology of polycrystalline homopolymers is necessarily dependent on the same factor . </s>
<s> The preparation of such products is not new , but the systems heretofore employed in polymerizations have commanded considerable experimental skill and starting materials of a high purity . </s>
<s> Upon completion of the purging step , additional initiator appropriate for the molecular weight of the sample desired is added , and the system is then warmed to the polymerization temperature , at which the reaction is allowed to go to completion . </s>

<s> With the development of nuclear technology , isotopic materials , and machine radiation sources in recent years , the possibilities of applying ionizing radiation to the preservation of foods attracted the attention of investigators in the United States and throughout the world . </s>
<s> Interest remained , however , in the possibility that it would serve as a useful supplementary method for counteracting spoilage losses and for preserving some foods at lower over-all costs than freezing , or without employing heat or chemicals with their attendant taste alterations . </s>
<s> The presence of parasitic organisms such as Trichinella spiralis in pork introduces another factor which must be dealt with in food processing . </s>
<s> Ionizing radiation can cause the destruction of microorganisms and insects involved in food spoilage or , at lower doses , can inhibit their action . </s>
<s> It furnishes a means of destroying insects in stored grain products as well as certain parasitic organisms present in meats . </s>
<s> For radiosterilization , to destroy all organisms for long-term preservation -- about 4.5 Mrad for nonacid foods of low salt content . </s>
<s> For destruction of insects -- about 25,000 Aj . </s>
<s> In this respect , the general palatability and individual acceptance of most radiosterilized foods has , to date , been found to be low in comparison with fresh and commercially processed foods . </s>
<s> Of the various particle accelerators , the Van De Graff machines , resonant transformers , and linear accelerators are the principal ones available for commercial use . </s>
<s> Partly because low-level heat treatment is needed to inactivate enzymes before radiosterilization , treated fresh meats have the appearance of boiled or canned meat . </s>
<s> Ground meats such as fresh pork sausage and hamburger have a relatively short shelf life under refrigeration , and radiopasteurization might be thought to offer distinctly improved keeping qualities . </s>
<s> The problems of color change by blanching and liquid accumulation within the package are the same as for solid cuts . </s>
<s> Specialty cooked items containing meat portions , as in `` frozen dinners '' might offer a potential use for radiopasteurization . </s>
<s> Under the conditions of comparison , it will be noted that : ( 1 ) </s>
<s> Radiosterilization ( at 3 Mrad ) is more expensive than canning , particularly for the cesium-137 source . </s>
<s> At sterilizing doses , good palatability results , with a minimum of changes in appearance , taste , and odor . </s>

<s> It can be seen that the force is characteristic of the removal process and changes abruptly from cutting to cracking to peeling removal . </s>
<s> Also , it can be readily seen that the cutting and peeling types of failure show a steady state response , while the cracking mechanism is of a dynamic nature . </s>
<s> Cutting mechanism of cohesive failure </s>
<s> Af is the normal compressive force acting on the shear plane ; ; </s>
<s> The blunter the knife , the higher is the value of Af . </s>
<s> The value of Af can readily be assessed by determining the frictional force exerted on the knife while running over the previously stripped coating track under various external loadings . </s>
<s> A straight line relationship is usually observed in a plot of Af against load L , having slope k , and Af . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> Chipping mechanism of cohesive failure </s>
<s> Although a large number of coatings systems , particularly at low thicknesses fail cohesively by the cutting mechanism , frequently a second type of cohesive failure may also take place . </s>
<s> This is a chipping , dynamic type failure encountered with very brittle coatings resins or very highly pigmented films . </s>
<s> Urethane foam , as only one example , was only introduced commercially in this country in 1955 . </s>
<s> Better `` hand '' , a more luxurious feel , and better insulating properties were claimed to be the result . </s>
<s> Most commercial uses of urethane foams require densities between 2 and 30 lb. / cu. ft. for rigid foams , between 1 and 3 lb. / cu. ft. for flexible foams . </s>
<s> Thermal conductivity is directly traceable to the material's porous , air-cell construction which effectively traps air or a gas in the maze of minute bubbles which form its composition . </s>
<s> Flexural strength : </s>
<s> The foam can be made into slab stock and cut to shape , it can be molded , it can be poured-in-place , it can be applied by spray guns , etc. . </s>
<s> Profile cutting machines are available which can split foam to any desired thickness and produce sine , triangle , trapezoid , and other profiles in variable heights , dimensions , etc. . </s>
<s> Molding </s>
<s> Closed molding generally resulted in parts weighing more ( because of higher density ) than parts fabricated from free-blown foams . </s>
<s> The introduction of one-shot polyether foam systems , aided by the development of new catalysts , helped to alleviate some of the problems of closed molding . </s>

<s> For phosphor to fiber and fiber to air surfaces , and assuming Af , we obtain Af percent . </s>
<s> As the index of refraction of photosensitive surfaces of the SbCs-type lies around 2 , the Fresnel losses at the fiber-photocathode interface are about 0.5 percent and the Af factor for the interstage coupler is 0.95 . </s>
<s> It might be anticipated that multiple coatings will reduce end reflection losses even further . </s>
<s> The internal losses are due to absorption and the small but finite losses suffered in the numerous internal reflections due to deviations from the prescribed , cylindrical fiber cross-section and minute imperfections of the core-jacket interface . </s>

<s> resolution limitations in a single stage </s>
<s> The resolution limitations for a single stage are given by the inherent resolution of the electron optical system as well as the resolution capabilities of the cathodoluminescent viewing screen . </s>
<s> The possibility of a space charge blowup of the screen crossover of the elementary electron bundles has been pointed out . </s>
<s> It is obvious that such an influence can only be expected in the final stage of an image intensifier at rather high output levels . </s>
<s> Space charge influences will also decrease at increased voltages . </s>
<s> It should be noted that photoluminescence , due to `` Bremsstrahlung '' generated within the viewing screen by electron impact , appears to be important only if anode voltages in excess of 30 KV are utilized . </s>

<s> Proceeding in this way , from one to two and from two to three stages , we may gradually build up the policy for any number . </s>
<s> To see how important this economy is , let us suppose that there are M operating variables at each stage and that the state is specified by N variables ; ; </s>
<s> this number will be of the order of Af . </s>
<s> If all the operating variables were varied simultaneously , Af operations would be required to do the same job , and as R increases this increases very much more rapidly than the number of operations required by the dynamic program . </s>
<s> If the problem is enlarged to require a complete coverage of feed states , Af operations are needed by the dynamic program and Af by the direct search . </s>
<s> The principle of optimality thus brings a vital organization into the search for the optimal policy of a multistage decision process . </s>
<s> Consider the process illustrated in Fig. 2.1 , consisting of R distinct stages . </s>
<s> These will be numbered in the direction opposite to the flow of the process stream , so that stage R is the T stage from the end . </s>
<s> We write this Af . </s>
<s> We also see how the results may be presented , although if n , the number of state variables , is large any tabulation will become cumbersome . </s>
<s> Proceeding in this way up the table we extract the complete optimal policy and , if it is desired , we can check on Af by evaluating Af at the last stage . </s>
<s> It may be that the objective function depends not only on Af but also on Af , as when the cost of the operating policy is considered . </s>
<s> Then Af , the maximization being over all admissible Af and the integration over the whole of stage space . </s>

<s> The restrained gyro-stabilized platform with reasonable response characteristics operates with an approximate equation of motion , neglecting transient effects , as follows : Af where U is a torque applied about the output axis of the controlling gyro . </s>

<s> Finally , when the accelerometer output is zero , the entire system remains stationary , and the platform is , by definition , leveled . </s>
<s> In practice , the preflight leveling process takes place with the system mounted in the airframe . </s>
<s> The automatic leveling system described in this section is readily adaptable to a gyro-stabilized platform consisting of three integrating gyros . </s>
<s> However , the leveling operation can be maintained and controlled remotely with no mechanical or optical contact with the platform . </s>
<s> In brief , the human replaces amplifier Af in Figs. 7-1 and 7-2 . </s>
<s> If high accuracy is required in preflight leveling , it is usually necessary to integrate or doubly integrate the accelerometer outputs ( this also minimizes the noise problem ) . </s>
<s> The platform accelerometers must be slightly modified for this procedure . </s>
<s> Obviously , the heading accuracy is lessened by such techniques since errors are introduced because of motion of the stand . </s>
<s> Gyrocompass alignment is an automatic heading system which depends upon the characteristic of one gyro to establish true heading . </s>
<s> The accelerometers are mounted rigidly on the platform . </s>
<s> If the platform is not properly headed , the X-gyro input axis will see a component of the earth's rotation . </s>

<s> Now she kept herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger and said `` Toot '' ! ! </s>

<s> She fell asleep leaning on her hand , hearing the house creaking as though it were a living a private life of its own these two hundred years , hearing the birds rustling in their cages and the occasional whirring of wings as one of them landed on the table and walked across the newspaper to perch in the crook of her arm . </s>
<s> She stood up , smoothing her hair down , straightening her clothes , feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping darkness outside , and , above everything else , for the absence of the need to answer , to respond , to be aware even of Stowey coming in or going out , and yet , now that she was beginning to cook , she glimpsed a future without him , a future alone like this , and the pain made her head writhe , and in a moment she found it hard to wait for Lucretia to come with her guests . </s>

<s> There was not anything she could do there , but that was where everyone was , or would be . </s>
<s> Off and on , all day , someone would be wiping at the powdery gray dust that settled over everything . </s>
<s> They were an old fat couple ( as Linda Kay described them to herself ) , a thick middle-aged man , and a girl about ten or twelve . </s>
<s> All the women got up and offered their chairs , and when they were all seated again , the guests made their inquiries and their explanations . </s>
<s> `` We were on our vacation in Canada '' , Howard explained , in a muffled voice that must have been used to booming , `` and the news didn't catch up with us till we were nearly home . </s>
<s> We came on as soon as we could '' . </s>
<s> Carrying it to the living room , she imagined the picture she made : tall and roundly slim , a bit sophisticated in her yellow sheath , with a graceful swingy walk that she had learned as a twirler with the school band . </s>
<s> `` Oh that's Linda Kay '' , Mama Albright said fondly . </s>
<s> `` Let's see '' , Cousin Ada said . </s>
<s> `` He's ten years younger than Ernest . </s>
<s> He got in the oil business out at Odessa and lucked into some money '' . </s>
<s> `` Say , did you know they're fixing to have a two-day antelope season on the Double J '' ? ? </s>
<s> He was talking about antelope again when they woke up . </s>
<s> There never was a season before , but now they want to thin 'em out on account of the drouth '' . </s>
<s> Bobby Joe was trying to get Linda Kay to say she would cook one if he brought it home . </s>
<s> `` Cook a whole antelope '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` Why , I couldn't even cook a piece of antelope steak ; ; </s>
<s> I never even saw any '' . </s>
<s> They all sat around and drank ice water , and the men smoked , and everybody had a good time . </s>
<s> Howard , who had been sitting against the wall , said he needed more fresh air , and took the spot on the edge of the porch where Bobby Joe had been sitting . </s>
<s> There was little enough time to contemplate them , however ; ; </s>
<s> `` This is my hen ledger '' , he informed him in an absorbed way . </s>
<s> A knocking at Alex's door roused him at six o'clock the following morning . </s>
<s> and hopes that the chambermaid and patronne would still be abed began to rise in Alex's well exercised breast . </s>
<s> `` Vous voulez vos petits dejeuners tout de suite alors '' ? ? </s>
<s> Alex told her that there was no hurry for their breakfasts , trying at the same time to effect a speedy separation of the persons before and behind him . </s>
<s> Ejaculated the surprised woman , looking at Alex for an explanation but he , parting from her without ceremony , only offered a few words about the doctor's provincial American speech and a state of nerves brought on by the demands of his work . </s>
<s> With that he hurried up the stairs , followed by her suspicious gaze . </s>
<s> When Alex entered his room , the doctor was already preparing a nest in the straw case , six eggs ready for the hen's attentions . </s>
<s> It was Giselle , the fille de chambre , come to clean the room , and while she stood before him with ears pricked up and regard all curiosity , explaining her errand , Alex could see from the corner of his eye the doctor doing all he could to calm the displeased bird . </s>
<s> The doctor instantly asked . </s>
<s> The doctor's mind was working at a great speed ; ; </s>
<s> they passed behind him and got to Alex's room unnoticed . </s>
<s> Sighing , Leona dropped the paper and stood up . </s>
<s> `` I guess I better get ready to go '' . </s>
<s> He drew back , embarrassed and pleased . </s>
<s> `` I don't mean Miss Ada ! ! </s>
<s> What you think I care about that ? ? </s>
<s> -- and flounced to the sink , where she began noisily to wash her hands . </s>
<s> `` How you going to work with a child hanging on you '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` I've been bursting my lungs for you '' , Mr. Jack complained . </s>
<s> `` This coat looks like a rag heap '' . </s>
<s> There were a few blades of lint on the shoulder . </s>
<s> `` Good-by , Winston '' , Mr. Jack said , giving a final set to his hat . </s>
<s> Winston watched him hurry down the drive to his car ; ; </s>
<s> That house was ten years off his life let himself . </s>
<s> The tulips and the big pink peonies had been blooming along the drive , and he had walked up from the bus almost singing . </s>
<s> Still , he had liked the way she had looked , in a fresh , neat cotton dress -- citron yellow , if he remembered . </s>
<s> where would she go for her gardening now ? ? </s>
<s> she had on her Easter suit , blue , with lavender binding . </s>
<s> `` He's used it every day ; ; </s>
<s> And it was his main present ! ! </s>

<s> These letters became the center of my existence . </s>
<s> The letters took their source from a stream of my imagination in which I was transformed into a young man not unlike my bunkmate Eliot Sands -- he of the porch steps anecdotes -- who smoked cigarettes , performed the tango , wore fifty dollar suits , and sneaked off into the dark with girls to do unimaginable things with them . </s>
<s> Like Eliot , in my fantasies , I had a proud bearing and , with a skill that was vaguely continental , I would lead Jessica through an evening of dancing and handsome descriptions of my newest exploits , would guide her gently to the night's climax which , in my dreams , was always represented by our almost suffocating one another to death with deep , moist kisses burning with love . </s>
<s> They caused my love for Jessica to become warmer and at the same time more hopeless , as if my adolescent self knew that only torment would ever bring me the courage to ask to see her again . </s>
<s> She was wearing her dark hair in two , thick braids to attain an `` American Girl '' effect she thought was appropriate to Halloween . </s>
<s> It made her look sweet and schoolgirlish , I was excited to be with her , but I did not know how to express it . </s>
<s> We blushed and were flustered , and it turned out to be the fleetest brush of lips upon cheek . </s>
<s> Was it preferable to meet her at home or in the city ? ? </s>
<s> When in one letter Jessica informed me that her father did not like the idea of her going out alone on New Year's Eve , I knew for a moment an immense relief ; ; </s>
<s> Cardboard noisemakers , substitutes for the unavailable tin models , were being hawked and bought at makeshift stands every few yards along Broadway , and one's ears were continually serenaded by the horns' rasps and bleats . </s>
<s> Was I supposed to buy a funny hat and a rattle for Jessica ? ? </s>
<s> Suppose at this very moment her father was calling my house in an effort to cancel the plans ? ? </s>
<s> All about me there was a hectic interplay of meetings taking place , like abrupt , jerky scenes in old silent movies , joyous greetings and beginnings , huggings and kissings , enthusiastic forays into the festive night . </s>
<s> An interne , a nurse and two attendants were in charge of us . </s>
<s> It seemed incredible , as I listened to the monotonous drone of voices and smelled the fetid odors coming from the patients , that technically I was a ward of the state of Illinois , going to a hospital for the mentally ill . </s>
<s> We had become good friends during my stay at Cook County Hospital . </s>
<s> I'm interested in every patient I've helped take care of . </s>
<s> I wanted to go to college , too '' -- </s>
<s> `` Why didn't you '' ? ? </s>
<s> I asked . </s>
<s> Her eyes flashed angrily . </s>
<s> I'll tell you why I didn't go to college ; ; </s>
<s> I'm the oldest of six children . </s>
<s> When she had finished I said : </s>
<s> `` My father is a sergeant of detectives and has been attached to Homicide for five years . </s>
<s> `` I like to dance '' , she said , then turned and walked away . </s>
<s> It seemed to me that my life was destined to be one brilliant failure after another . </s>
<s> Then later I had quit my safe , secure five-a-week spot on a network soap opera to take a part in this play . </s>
<s> I knew that I'd soon be back working as an orderly at the hospital or as a counterman at Union News or Schraffts while waiting for another acting job to open . </s>
<s> `` Why don't you bastards lay off for a while '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` Yes , of course , Mr. Nelson '' . </s>
<s> `` All right , you bastards '' , I said , `` the great actor is about to buy a drink '' . </s>
<s> `` You Mr. Nelson '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` Mr. Wycoff's car is waiting for you at the east entrance '' . </s>
<s> The Oldsmobile with the license number JYJ 114 was in stall number five . </s>
<s> `` Sure '' , I told him . </s>
<s> `` I haven't made up my mind yet '' , I said . </s>
<s> I have a couple of them I'm figuring on ; ; </s>
<s> His signal was coming loud and clear and then all of a sudden it turned to a buzz . </s>
<s> It was a fairly modern motel with quite a bit of electrical display in front . </s>
<s> I remembered it was the Peeping Tom place . </s>
<s> He had written out the license number of his car but had transposed the last two figures , an old dodge which is still good . </s>
<s> If he does , it's still better than an even chance he won't notice the transposition of the numbers , and if he should notice it , the thing can be passed off as an honest mistake . </s>
<s> She was complying with the law in regard to registrations but she certainly wasn't checking license numbers or bothering the tenants . </s>
<s> There are ice cubes in a container at the far end and in another by the office . </s>
<s> We like to run a nice quiet place '' . </s>
<s> I got in the car , drove down to the drive-in and ordered a couple of hamburgers with everything included , a cup of coffee and the fastest service possible . </s>
<s> The place wasn't particularly busy at that time of night , and the girl who was waiting on me , who was clothed in the tightest-fitting pair of slacks I had ever seen on a woman and a sweater that showed everything there was -- and there was lots of it -- wanted to be sociable . </s>
<s> She asked . </s>
<s> That's when my evening commences '' . </s>
<s> `` I'll be here at ten-fifty-five '' , I said . </s>
<s> `` Oh , you ! ! </s>
<s> Then I shut off the device again . </s>
<s> `` -- it says police right on the door '' . </s>
<s> `` A night policeman just like in the States . </s>
<s> You know '' ? ? </s>
<s> In a flash she was away to the back , paying no attention to three angry shouts from the male throats . </s>
<s> It was dark inside the room but enough light spilled from the restaurant behind her to enable her to make out a round table with a green cloth top . </s>
<s> The gun followed her . </s>
<s> As she reached Dave and felt his arm go around her , felt him pull her to the safety of his person , she knew with the certainty of despair that something bad had happened to Lauren . </s>
<s> The two men watched as Dave closed the door behind them , watched them cross the sidewalk to their car . </s>
<s> Got it '' ? ? </s>
<s> Good . </s>
<s> `` Remember how she looked when Barney held the door for her ? ? </s>
<s> Vince swore . </s>
<s> `` Why does everything have to happen to me '' ? ? </s>
<s> He spoke soothingly . </s>
<s> After Guardino's left , we'll dump the kid somewhere near the border where she kin get home . </s>
<s> In the tool crib she can't get away '' . </s>
<s> `` Dammit all , Vince . </s>
<s> I wish you luck when you try scaring that kid '' . </s>
<s> `` In a Chicago slum just like you . </s>
<s> She was glad the fat man had left . </s>
<s> Still no answer . </s>
<s> He dropped it and carefully ground it to nothing with the sole of his heavy shoe . </s>
<s> Now he looked at her . </s>
<s> And was he afraid to do anything as definite as releasing her ? ? </s>
<s> Her heart was thumping painfully ; ; </s>
<s> And what would her mother be doing right now ? ? </s>
<s> Why don't we drive around the corner '' ? ? </s>
<s> Suppose Lauren comes looking for us ? ? </s>
<s> I can sit here in the car while you walk around the corner '' . </s>
<s> He said , `` I'm not going to leave my wife and my car out here in sight of those '' -- </s>
<s> His jowls were spiked by barbs of graying beard . </s>
<s> This was Acey Squire , proprietor of the juke joint . </s>
<s> He avoided showing any surprise or annoyance when no one answered him . </s>
<s> The seventeen men stood and stared at him for a moment longer . </s>
<s> Perhaps it was Dora May . </s>
<s> There were other farmhouses nearby . </s>
<s> There was another on this side , a little further down . </s>
<s> And Jarrodsville was more than three miles away , down an old dirt road that the rain had turned into a quagmire . </s>
<s> As he approached the first farmhouse , thunder sounded behind him again , closer now and louder , like a steadily advancing drum corps . </s>
<s> There were several people on the porch of the farmhouse . </s>
<s> For just an instant he thought of appealing to them for help . </s>
<s> Even the eyes of the smallest children seemed malicious . </s>
<s> They , too , stared at him . </s>
<s> It was probably one of Kipling's tales of the British Army . </s>
<s> He had turned his ankle slightly , and it pained him . </s>
<s> He did not dare climb back up to the road . </s>
<s> He was deep in water , but at least they could not reach him there . </s>
<s> The fence , his only refuge when the metal death came roaring at him , was made of rails , all right , but the rails were protected by a thick screening of barbed wire that would rip his flesh if he pressed against it . </s>
<s> The cars must have had their gas pedals pushed down to the floor boards . </s>
<s> There was someone in front with the sheriff . </s>

<s> The sheriff was occupied with maneuvering the car around in a very narrow space . </s>
<s> He turned his head and said , `` Alvarez will definitely be in a back room at the Jai Alai Club on South Beach within an hour . </s>
<s> Shayne looked at his watch . </s>
<s> `` A lady . </s>
<s> As he drove , he filled in Timothy Rourke briefly on the events of the evening after leaving the reporter to go to the Peralta house , and on his own surmises . </s>
<s> `` I don't know whether that threatening letter of hers has anything to do with this situation or not , but I want to see who takes the call '' . </s>
<s> `` That story of hers about an unsigned note directing her to be there tonight sounds completely phony . </s>
<s> Rourke could see it better out the right-hand side , and he said , `` yes . </s>
<s> Turn to the left , I think , for that number you gave me . </s>
<s> Shayne noted idly that it carried Miami Beach license plates as he approached , and then saw the flare of a match in the front seat as they passed , indicating that it was occupied . </s>
<s> He turned to see the briefly-illumed faces of two men in the parked car just as Rourke said , `` It's the next house , Mike . </s>
<s> `` I told you , Mike '' , said Rourke in an aggrieved voice . </s>
<s> `` Did you see the car parked across the street '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` What are they doing here '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` The things you talk me into , Mike . </s>

<s> As the detective slid it into his pocket , Rourke asked sadly , `` What in hell are you going to do , Mike '' ? ? </s>
<s> Outside , Shayne hesitated when he saw that Rourke had parked his coupe directly in front of the bar headed south . </s>
<s> He hoped he wouldn't be forced to use it in taking care of the Beach detectives , but its weight was comforting at his hip . </s>
<s> He dropped him into the street a couple of feet away from Geely's recumbent figure and stared down at both of them for a moment before kicking the big man lightly in the side . </s>
<s> They were both breathing heavily , out cold , and Shayne didn't think either of them had recognized him or could describe him . </s>
<s> They went up onto a front porch and into a small hallway where a dim bulb burned high in the ceiling . </s>
<s> The stairway on the right was dark , but there was a wall-switch at the bottom which lighted another dim bulb at the top , and they went up . </s>
<s> There were two front rooms , both dark behind their transoms , and there was no sound or light in the entire house to indicate that any of the occupants were awake . </s>
<s> Mickey paused with him , waiting , no longer impatient , trying now to think it out , do a little planning . </s>
<s> He looked down over the banister at the hotel desk , with the telephone and pen set . </s>
<s> I wouldn't have to tell them I had Roberts -- </s>
<s> He was fuzzy in his mind and , for a moment , helpless on the lobby floor , but he was conscious , and free of the weight of Roberts' body . </s>
<s> He rose stiffly , forcing his knees to lock . </s>
<s> They moved in a series of rhythmic fits and starts , a macabre dance -- two steps back , two steps forward , two steps back . </s>
<s> Mickey's guts twisted with the effort , but he kept his eye on the weapon . </s>
<s> He got a knee up into Roberts' belly , used both hands and heaved him clear , then scrambled to his feet . </s>

<s> Actually it was no more than eight or ten minutes , and the sum of his reasoning came to this : </s>
<s> There's no way to take him in now and keep those other two -- Wister and the one who hired the two of them -- from finding out about Roberts and lamming out . </s>
<s> When he had closed the suitcase he found a rag and moved about the room , wiping carefully everything he might have touched . </s>
<s> He tossed the bag into the pit and watched dry dust spray up around it . </s>
<s> He could feel himself falling in with it and being unable to get out . </s>
<s> He gave it a strong push , heard it slide , then tumble dryly into the hole . </s>
<s> There was little chance anyone would enter this shaft during the winter . </s>
<s> He made his way back to the Jeep . </s>
<s> He wiped the steering wheel and all the places he might have touched the Jeep . </s>
<s> Jeb cautioned him not to be too hopeful and then , ignoring his own advice , said excitedly , `` But it does sound good . </s>

<s> Pity we don't know more about him . </s>
<s> He stood up . </s>
<s> Well , I do remember one . </s>
<s> `` What reason did she give '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` Now how in hell would I remember that '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` Have they inherited some money or something '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` Sure '' , said Hirey . </s>
<s> `` I'll just leave the door open . </s>
<s> When they had gone , he stood for a minute breathing in the mustiness of old paper and leather which the busily thrumming air conditioner couldn't quite dispel . </s>
<s> The one line on the bride said she was Miss Lisa Carmody from Baton Rouge . </s>

<s> He glanced at his watch , saw it was only seven , and decided to indulge his weakness now . </s>
<s> Something else distracted him , yet there was no sound , only tomblike silence . </s>
<s> To search his room at the motel ? ? </s>
<s> There would be all the nuisance of contacting someone else to take over . </s>
<s> `` Time '' , said Angie , and he smiled very sweet and slow at Mr. Skyros . </s>

<s> but all the same he thought now , uneasily , of the way in which Angelo earned his living -- and paid for his own stuff -- and eyed the soft smile , and the spaniel-like dark eyes , and he felt a little ill . </s>
<s> `` I tell you , you want to leave it that way , I don't fool around with it . </s>

<s> Angelo gave him an affectionate smile . </s>
<s> But aside from everything else , it would scarcely be pleasant to have dealings with one who was nominally an underling and actually held -- you could say -- the whip hand . </s>
<s> You don't need worry , Angelo . </s>
<s> Or maybe I call you -- tonight ? ? </s>
<s> `` Sure , Mr. Skyros . </s>
<s> Sure . </s>
<s> I bring you the cash , say five hundred for ten decks . </s>

<s> She wouldn't be going to get that for an hour or so after Katya had left , go do the daily shopping . </s>
<s> `` You've give me the wrong change '' , said the customer sharply . </s>

<s> She ate what she could and went out along the covered passageway , with the rain dripping from the vines . </s>
<s> Sarah found the right key and unlocked the door . </s>
<s> It was a long , low room , like a root cellar , for it was banked up with soil , and vines had run rampant over that , too . </s>
<s> The shelves looked emptier than when Miss Celie had shown her the storeroom , and since the men from the Commissary had called ; ; </s>
<s> Besides , there was something hysterical and silly , something almost childish about an attempt to frighten her . </s>
<s> Maude was neither hysterical nor silly and Sarah rather doubted if she had ever been childish . </s>

<s> Always provided that Lucien himself had not dosed her coffee with opium , she thought , as coldly and sharply , again , as Maude might have said it . </s>

<s> The figures on the worksheet paper in front of her were jumping and waving around so badly it was all she could do to make them out clearly enough to copy them with the typewriter . </s>
<s> He wasn't like so many other men . </s>
<s> When he left , she knew she would never see him again . </s>
<s> Except for that one morning . </s>
<s> As a result , he never looked for it . </s>
<s> Kitti was thirty years younger than Stanley , taller than Stanley , prettier than Stanley had any right to hope for , much less expect . </s>
<s> Stanley had filled out the return and because , when he was finished , it was close to the lunch hour , he had politely asked Kitti to join him , never expecting her to accept . </s>

<s> `` Come here '' . </s>
<s> I tried . </s>

<s> He approached the horse and laid a hand on the stallion's quivering neck . </s>
<s> `` They'll trample it down . </s>
<s> `` Lived alone here for three years , before any man came . </s>
<s> It looked as Gavin had first seen it years ago , on those nights when he slept alone by his campfire and waked suddenly to the hoot of an owl or the rustle of a blade of grass in the moon's wind -- a savage land , untenanted and brooding , too strong to be broken by the will of men . </s>
<s> They greeted the news angrily , as though they had been cheated of purpose . </s>
<s> He remembered Gavin's smirk , his own cringing feeling , his impotence . </s>
<s> And you stand by like a fool and let him do it '' </s>
<s> `` You brought him back to this valley thinkin he would help you find your boy . </s>
<s> He did not look back ; ; </s>
<s> And he was fleeing , running -- fleeing his death and his life at the same time . </s>
<s> The land over which he sped was the land he had created and lived in : his valley . </s>
<s> `` You are very brave '' . </s>

<s> `` Dean and myself will try to cut out horses to ride '' , he said . </s>

<s> He was thinking that the way she had responded to his own kiss hadn't meant what he had believed it had . </s>
<s> He kissed her also , and with deep tenderness . </s>
<s> `` The way you were careful '' ? ? </s>
<s> He wanted no more sentimental scenes with her . </s>
<s> `` Stay well back of me '' , he said . </s>
<s> `` I'm going to walk up to the horses , bold as brass , pretending I'm one of the guerrillas . </s>

<s> `` Why not you '' ? ? </s>
<s> Dean still hesitated , but Mike lifted him almost bodily into the saddle and thrust the reins in his hand . </s>
<s> `` Favor him and save something in case you hit trouble . </s>
<s> That touched off a total stampede . </s>
<s> The guerrillas were swarming from their bivouac at the west end of the enclosure . </s>
<s> `` They're stealin' the stock '' ! ! </s>
<s> He scuttled in shadow along the east wall of the stockade and then followed the south wall until he was at the rear of the two frame buildings . </s>
<s> Mike made a dash to the rear of the frame buildings . </s>
<s> A lantern hung from a peg , giving light . </s>
<s> Mike seized a blanket from a pallet in a corner , spread it on the floor and used it to form a bag in which he placed his booty . </s>
<s> He looked at the looming hoods of the supply wagons , struck by a new inspiration . </s>
<s> Bursting paper cartridges , he scattered powder beneath the nearest wagon and dumped the contents of the canister upon it . </s>
<s> Powder flame gushed beneath the wagon . </s>
<s> A bullet tore the earth from beneath his foot when he was a stride or two from safety . </s>
<s> Mike rolled to Susan , grasped her around the knees , dragging her off her feet . </s>
<s> Calhoun shouted . </s>
<s> `` Run 'em right into the spring ! ! </s>

<s> Mr. Manuel whispered in the ears of the Sioux that the Cheyennes were comin' to raid 'em for their horses . </s>
<s> Hell , they were fightin' each other so hard they had no time for anyone else . </s>
<s> `` There's no war on now '' . </s>
<s> Once we get over the mountains others will come along . </s>

<s> Oso slept unconcernedly , his rifle cradled in his arms ; ; </s>
<s> Next to him was a young boy I was sure had sat near me at one of the trading sessions . </s>
<s> His mouth was open , his neck corded with the strain of his screams . </s>
<s> I saw the pony fall like a stone and the young warrior flew over its head , bouncing like a rubber ball . </s>
<s> `` Lead up ! ! </s>
<s> The morning air was filled with the sweetish odor of new-spilled blood , the acrid stench of frightened horses , and the bitterness of burned powder . </s>
<s> A rifle cracked ; ; </s>
<s> the square head fell over . </s>
<s> There was a ragged volley . </s>
<s> This time he delayed so long that some of the engages shouted frantically , but they held their fire . </s>
<s> I heard the whir of an ax and a Canadian's face burst apart in a bloody spray . </s>
<s> I saw Little Billy rise and fire almost point blank and an Indian's face became shattered flesh and bone . </s>
<s> A second leaped from his horse to the top of the bale , firing four arrows in such rapid succession it didn't seem possible they were in flight . </s>
<s> Above me a dark rider was whipping his pony with a quirt in an attempt to hurdle the bales . </s>
<s> It was pitiful to see the thin ranks of warriors , old and young , wheeling and twisting their ponies frantically from side to side only to be tumbled bleeding from their saddles by the relentless slam , slam of the cruelly efficient Hawkinses . </s>
<s> He was losing patience again . </s>
<s> An hour before , with the children asleep and nothing but the strange darkness , he would have appreciated company . </s>
<s> She had helped him change his mind . </s>
<s> Let it burn down . </s>
<s> He was taken aback . </s>
<s> It's bigger than it has to be , though I don't see where it's doing any harm . </s>
<s> She studied it for a long time . </s>
<s> `` You bought it '' ? ? </s>
<s> The girl laughed . </s>
<s> And it doesn't make any difference . </s>
<s> I meant what I said about that fire . </s>
<s> Be sure it's out when you leave . </s>
<s> He got up slowly , and she was already on her feet , and he stood facing her . </s>
<s> But a moment later he brought his horse forward into the light , and Wilson had a good look at him . </s>
<s> `` I thought I told you to stay home '' . </s>
<s> The half-breed eased the Winchester down and rested it across his lap . </s>
<s> He took it without flinching . </s>
<s> He watched the half-breed as he turned silently . </s>
<s> Wilson brushed the dust from his coat . </s>
<s> Not yours . </s>
<s> She wiped it off with the sleeve of her coat . </s>
<s> But I'll know how to handle you next time '' . </s>
<s> She finally regained her balance and got up in the saddle . </s>
<s> They weren't sleeping , of course , but they thought they were doing him a favor by pretending . </s>
<s> Already some of the pain had gone from Amelia's death . </s>
<s> The land wasn't all Wilson had expected of it . </s>
<s> And there was a house ; ; </s>
<s> 2 </s>
<s> They had the house cleaned up by noon , and Wilson sent the boy out to the meadow to bring in the horses . </s>
<s> He had an uneasy feeling about it . </s>
<s> The first part of the road was steep , but it leveled off after the second bend and curled gradually into the valley . </s>
<s> The place was quiet . </s>
<s> Such was my state of mind that I did not question the possibility of this ; ; </s>
<s> I was nearly thirty at the time . </s>
<s> It was obvious that he wished himself different from the sort of person he thought he was . </s>
<s> Noticing my disappointment he attempted to salvage what scraps and shreds of authority he felt might still be clinging to his person . </s>
<s> He made a show of rearranging my forms on the shelf . </s>
<s> Later I would remember what this pompous little man had told me about the worth of a ticket . </s>
<s> I knew that three or four of them were almost always present in the hall , but what they were doing , and exactly where , I could not tell . </s>
<s> This light did not penetrate very far back into the hall , and my eyes were hindered rather than aided by the dim daylight entering through the fan vents when I tried to pick out whatever might be lying , or squatting , on the floor below . </s>
<s> The hall , on the other hand , appeared lifeless and deserted on these long waterfront afternoons . </s>
<s> I returned to the hall , despite my dislike for the clerk . </s>
<s> he looked dapper in a lightweight summer suit , brown silk tie and green-tinted soft collar . </s>
<s> He wore perforated , white-topped shoes ; ; </s>
<s> I had the impression that he had read my forms , perhaps several times . </s>
<s> As he lowered himself on the chair behind his desk I wondered what this dapper , slightly ridiculous man could possibly have to do with the workings of the hall . </s>
<s> He spoke , in a voice as immaculate as his appearance . </s>
<s> Why had I registered ? ? </s>
<s> Though I doubted that he would understand me , I told the director my motives for applying . </s>

<s> But ten years in prison had taught him realities . </s>
<s> It was all right to put a bunch of ranchers onto horses , to call them Night Riders , to set out to attack the largest mining combination the country had ever seen if all they wanted was adventure . </s>
<s> He too knew the agony of going for weeks , sometimes months without the solace of tobacco . </s>
<s> Through the gloom he could not see the man beside him clearly but he knew him thoroughly . </s>
<s> For his first five years in prison , they had shared a cell . </s>

<s> When the station wagon drew abreast of the dusty dirt road that led up to the porch of the Culver house , Pamela turned the wheel , guiding the car to its familiar parking spot close to the house , and stopped . </s>
<s> If she , Pamela , were being held responsible for his crimes , then hers must be the final act of expiation . </s>
<s> She would return this symbol to the mountain , as one pours seed back into the soil every Spring or as ancient fertility cults demand annual human sacrifice . </s>
<s> Having persisted too long in deliberate ignorance and denial of the forces that threatened her , Pamela was relieved now to admit their potency and to be taking definite steps toward grappling with them . </s>
<s> Success depended upon maintaining her equanimity ; ; </s>
<s> Bushes and vines abetted the rocks in forming thorny detours for the struggling stranger , and without the direct light of the sun to act as compass , Pamela could no longer be positive of her direction . </s>
<s> She was sure she would reach the pool by climbing , and she clung to that belief despite the increasing number of obstacles . </s>
<s> Her arm bled slightly , and the offended skin cried out in pain . </s>
<s> It crept into the open neck of her blouse and slid down her body , seeping into her flesh through all the quivering pores of her skin . </s>
<s> The shadows of the trees engulfed her , foreclosing every possible exit from the grove . </s>
<s> She had been snared here by a vile sensuality that writhed around her throat in ever-tightening circles . </s>
<s> She had to move in some direction -- any direction that would take her away from this evil place . </s>
<s> Her own body protested , aching painfully where the blood in her veins had congealed , where cold demon wisps still clung and caressed . </s>
<s> She began it deliberately , so that none of her words would be lost on him . </s>

<s> He said he wanted very much to listen . </s>
<s> `` I think you stink , Tom Lord ! ! </s>
<s> `` Aah , go on '' , she said . </s>
<s> `` Just go the hell on '' . </s>
<s> Then he hunkered down on the heels of his handmade boots , peered into the orderly chaos of axle , shock absorber , and spring . </s>
<s> He went prone on his stomach , the better to pursue his examination . </s>
<s> Never , he'd once told Joyce , had he encountered any man or situation that called for a gun . </s>
<s> Just a big pile of self-confidence in an almost teensy package . </s>
<s> He could move very quickly , she knew ( although he seldom found occasion to do so ) , but he was more wiry than truly strong . </s>
<s> Why did these yokels still wear boots , anyway , when most had scarcely sat a horse in years ? ? </s>
<s> She snapped . </s>
<s> Then , with a shrug of pretended indifference , she took a compact from her purse and went through the motions of fixing her make-up . </s>
<s> He seemed very pleased with himself , as though some intricate scheme was working out exactly as he had planned . </s>
<s> `` So what's this all about '' ? ? </s>
<s> He said . </s>
<s> He was an honest man doing a hard job , and the implication that he was anything else was unbearable . </s>
<s> But you're all wrong , man ! ! </s>
<s> An' that could mean trouble with a fella that's workin' for crooks . </s>
<s> McBride couldn't do either , of course . </s>
<s> How could he exert authority over them -- make them toe the line , as he had to -- if he knuckled under to this small-town clown ? ? </s>
<s> McBride staggered into the street , flopped sprawling in the stinging dust . </s>
<s> Donna , his young wife , the girl who was both daughter and wife to him . </s>
<s> The Brannon outfit -- known as the Slash-B because of its brand -- reached Hondo Creek before sundown . </s>
<s> Two of the new hands , a Mexican named Jose Amado and a kid known only as Laredo , were picked for the first trick of riding night herd . </s>
<s> But they deliberately avoided the one subject that had them all curious : the failure of the boss's wife and son to join the outfit . </s>
<s> It especially bothered the older hands . </s>
<s> Billie had unhitched the mules from both Tom Brannon's and his father's wagon . </s>
<s> Hank had gathered wood for a cookfire , and his wife was busy at it now . </s>
<s> Whatever they are talking about ? ? </s>
<s> His face was clouded with unhappiness . </s>
<s> `` Let's hear it , anyway '' . </s>
<s> Hell , in a year or five or ten , the boy will have forgotten me -- his own father '' ! ! </s>
<s> What would you do in my place '' ? ? </s>
<s> Like Luis , I can't see something like this happening to me . </s>
<s> Where I go , she goes -- and the kids with us . </s>
<s> And the boy will need his mother . </s>
<s> They were silent for a little while , each looking glum . </s>
<s> He didn't want to put himself outside the law . </s>
<s> `` Probably just stepped out '' , he said . </s>
<s> `` Not there '' , he said , getting back onto his horse . </s>
<s> `` Now , listen '' -- Macklin began . </s>
<s> `` We'll talk over at your office '' . </s>
<s> `` Let's go , Marshal '' , Brannon said , and took him by the arm . </s>
<s> He looked at each of them in turn , Brannon last of all . </s>
<s> `` Every last one of you . </s>
<s> He lifted the skirt of Macklin's coat , took his gun from its holster , tossed it onto the desk . </s>
<s> Macklin balked again , not wanting to unlock and open the door . </s>
<s> He was uttering threats in a low but savage voice when they closed and padlocked the door . </s>
<s> Lewis was a man who had made a full-time job of cow stealing . </s>
<s> He had done his rustling openly and boasted about it . </s>
<s> William Lewis made the rounds of all who lived near him again , that August morning after a bullet landed at his feet , and once more he accused and threatened everyone . </s>
<s> This time Lewis had his own rifle in his hands , and he threw some answering fire back at the mysterious far-off shot , then spent most of the day searching out the area . </s>
<s> `` Just let me meet up with that damned bushwhackin' coward face-to-face '' ! ! </s>
<s> He slumped against a log fence rail , then tried to lift himself . </s>
<s> An inquest was held , and after a good deal of testimony about the anonymous notes , the county coroner estimated that the shooting had been done from a distance of 300 yards . </s>
<s> The former scout's alibi couldn't be shaken . </s>
<s> `` Three shots in that fella 'fore he hit the ground ! ! </s>
<s> You reckon there's two men in this state can shoot like that '' ? ? </s>
<s> Publicly , he denied everything . </s>
<s> The rustling problem was by no means solved . </s>
<s> He looked around in surprise , then noticed that Fred Powell was clutching his chest . </s>
<s> He heaved the dead man onto the buckboard , yelled and lashed at the team and got out of there fast . </s>
<s> But he brought back the sheriff and several deputies , and to the lawmen the entire affair seemed a repetition of the Lewis killing . </s>
<s> A detailed scouring of the entire area revealed nothing beyond a ledge of rocks that might have been the rifleman's hiding place . </s>
<s> `` And I sort o' got a corner on the market '' . </s>
<s> Even as he became widely known as a professional killer , nearly every cowboy and rancher in Wyoming seemed proud to call him a friend . </s>
<s> Which would you be most scairt of -- a dry-gulchin' or a shoot-down '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` Yeah , I can see that '' , the friend was forced to agree . </s>
<s> `` But well , it just don't seem sportin' somehow '' ! ! </s>
<s> The tall sunburnt rustler-hunter stared in amazement . </s>
<s> He echoed again in soft wonder . </s>
<s> I heard o' Texas cattlemen wrappin' a cow thief up in green hides and lettin' the sun shrink 'em and squeeze him to death . </s>
<s> But there's one thing I never seen or heard of , one thing I just don't think there is , and that's a sportin' way o' killin' a man '' ! ! </s>
<s> Houses of settlers who'd treated the company herds as a natural resource , free for the taking , were sitting empty , with weeds growing high in their yards . </s>
<s> Jury , judge and executioner were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could materialize anywhere , at any time , to dispense an ancient brand of justice the men of the new West had believed long outdated . </s>
<s> I'm sure you won't mind doing me a small favor '' . </s>
<s> `` It doesn't seem quite right , telling her a thing like that . </s>
<s> `` You know , Summers '' , he said thoughtfully . </s>
<s> `` Yes sir '' . </s>
<s> Horse smell was very strong , and he could hear the crunch of grain being ground between strong jaws . </s>
<s> There were two horses in the barn , a sway-backed dun and Jess Crouch's buckskin . </s>
<s> He slapped the buckskin again and it kicked wildly , its hoofs rattling the side of the stall . </s>
<s> '' </s>
<s> As he crossed to the side of the stall , Curt drew his gun and clicked back the hammer . </s>
<s> `` Your trigger-happy brother isn't in the house . </s>
<s> `` You're about as dumb as they come , Adams . </s>
<s> I don't know what you're up to , but when Brenner '' -- </s>
<s> Curt's fingers put a little more pressure on the trigger of his gun . </s>
<s> Apparently sensing this , and realizing that it gave him an advantage , Jess became bold . </s>
<s> If we was both armed , you wouldn't talk so tough '' . </s>
<s> `` No '' ? ? </s>
<s> He had found Curt's weakness , or what to Jess was a weakness , and was smart enough to take advantage of it . </s>
<s> He had to make Jess talk , and he had to do it before Stacey Black got curious and came to investigate . </s>
<s> Once more he lifted Jess's gun from its holster , only this time he tossed it into the stall with the frightened buckskin . </s>
<s> `` We'll do it another way , then '' , he said harshly . </s>
<s> By now Curt was seeing clearly again . </s>
<s> He stepped inside Jess's guard and landed two blows to the big man's belly , putting everything he had behind them . </s>
<s> Even Black's old crowbait began to snort , and from the house Black yelled , `` Jess ! ! </s>
<s> Jess didn't seem too sure himself . </s>
<s> Curt caught him flush on the nose with a blow which started at the floor . </s>
<s> Curt moved in and picked up his gun . </s>
<s> He shook loose straw out of the action , and placed the gun in his holster . </s>
<s> We're going someplace '' . </s>
<s> `` Who's in there '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` You're staying right here for a while . </s>
<s> He released her reluctantly for her enthusiastic reunion with Old Hap . </s>
<s> If I hadn't got Nate stopped when I did , my duds'd all be shot plumb to hell ! ! </s>
<s> The Burnsides , now ready to roll , were purposefully deaf to his cry . </s>
<s> `` Nate '' ! ! </s>
<s> But even a reunion as joyous as this one did not make a break in the routines of the day . </s>
<s> But with Bill O'Connor on the fiddle , and Gran Harrow exuberantly shouting `` Glory Be '' and `` Hallelujah '' above their united chant of the lilting old ballads , they played their quaint folk games with all the fervor and abandon of a real celebration . </s>
<s> `` Nor Methodists , neither '' , she replied . </s>
<s> Rod gave her a warm pat on the shoulder before he replied . </s>
<s> He looked down at his big hands and slowly flexed his long fingers . </s>
<s> No sooner were they through and the guards posted , than the whole camp turned in for a night of sound sleep . </s>
<s> Even the knowledge that she was losing another boy , as a mother always does when a marriage is made , did not prevent her from having the first carefree , dreamless sleep that she had known since they dropped down the canyon and into Bear Valley , way , way back there when they were crossing those other mountains . </s>
<s> Rod and Dan released their holds on the arms of her hickory rocker and exchanged embarrassed grins . </s>
<s> The two tall brothers waited silently while their mother handed Gran her cold snack and water jug , placed the chamber pot beside her feet , and returned to her place at the front of the wagon with Alice . </s>
<s> Dan asked Hez , who had limped back from his team to hold the notched-stick chair braces in place while his boys swung up the tailgate and tied it tight at the ends . </s>
<s> `` But the sun'll fry it out'n me onct we git to rolling '' . </s>
<s> `` Sally and her ma want to trade off on account of Harmony being so far along '' , Dan explained . </s>
<s> Rod looked apprehensively ahead at the narrowing , precipice-walled gorge . </s>
<s> While no larger than Dutch Springs , this mining supply town had the appearance of being far busier and more prosperous . </s>
<s> Looking the setup over , Stevens started coolly for the rear of the place . </s>
<s> With a bellow Carmer lunged at him . </s>
<s> Kneeling , Cobb planted a sturdy knee in the small of his back , holding him pinned . </s>
<s> `` By golly , Stevens ! ! </s>
<s> `` We know Penny spent some -- and Carmer must have dropped a few dollars getting that load on '' . </s>
<s> `` Shall we get out of here '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` You don't have to tell me '' , flashed Cobb . </s>
<s> Giving the other a dark look , he hauled his bronc around and trotted down off the street . </s>
<s> The truth was , the puncher was both bewildered and dismayed by his own mixed luck . </s>
<s> He asked himself . </s>
<s> but on the range gunfire had a meaning . </s>
<s> He tightened up in a twinkling . </s>
<s> Whoever was out there hiding in the brushy cover was besieging the Antler house and , having spotted his approach , was determined to drive him off before he could get into the fight . </s>
<s> If he wondered whether the attackers would allow him to pull away unmolested , he had his answer a moment later . </s>
<s> At the first shot Russ had hurled his mount to the left toward the side of the winding draw . </s>
<s> Early in November the clouds lifted enough to carry out the assigned missions . </s>
<s> Fleischman with eight was to patrol the Leyte Gulf area , with his main task to get any kamikaze before they got to the ships . </s>
<s> Each plane carried two five-hundred pound bombs . </s>
<s> A weapons carrier took Greg , Todman , Belton , Banjo Ferguson , and Walters and the others the two miles from the bivouac area to the strip . </s>
<s> There was a feeling that this mission would be canceled like all the others and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go on forever . </s>
<s> `` Yeah . </s>
<s> The control tower gave him immediate take-off permission , and the clean roar of the engine that took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of Donovan . </s>
<s> To the west , the dark green hills of Leyte were lost in the clouds about halfway up their slopes . </s>
<s> They would have to go west through the narrow river valley that separated Leyte from Samar and hope that it didn't close in before they returned . </s>
<s> Finally , as time began to run out , he headed into Ormoc and glide-bombed a group of houses that Intelligence had thought might contain Japanese supplies . </s>
<s> There was not enough room to make the usual vertical bomb run . </s>
<s> One of Greg's bombs hung up , and he was miles from the target before he could get rid of it . </s>
<s> Only one of the flight scored a direct hit and the rest blew up jungle . </s>
<s> Mercifully , it was still open . </s>
<s> Three bogies . </s>
<s> `` Zeros '' ! ! </s>
<s> And then he thought Todman might be right . </s>
<s> Japanese aircraft were strong on maneuverability , American on speed and firepower . </s>
<s> But the closing aircraft showed no sign of deviating from their original course . </s>
<s> `` Sweeney Blue , hit the deck . </s>
<s> They appeared to be the enemy . </s>
<s> If the turn was too tight , a barrel roll would bring them out . </s>
<s> He hauled back on the stick and felt his cheeks sag . </s>
<s> The enemy did not veer . </s>
<s> It did not seem possible that they hadn't been spotted . </s>
<s> Now ! ! </s>
<s> His burst held for a second on the engine section of the plane . </s>
<s> His speed was dropping rapidly . </s>
<s> If he spun out now , he would join his opponent on the ground . </s>
<s> I said that it didn't make any difference to me either , as far as I knew . </s>
<s> `` I'm a good Baptist , and drinking '' </s>
<s> Mrs. Roebuck very kindly let me drive through Sante Fe to a road which would , she said , lead us to Taos and then Raton and `` eventshahleh '' out of New Mexico . </s>
<s> Get in '' . </s>
<s> The straight , black hair flopped in a vigorous nod , the slender nose plunged toward glass teeth and drew safely back . </s>
<s> The truck was hurtling forward . </s>
<s> Whatever satisfaction that might offer . </s>
<s> Did an anteater want ants ? ? </s>
<s> The beer foamed furiously . </s>
<s> On unoccupied roadway the bottle shattered into a small amber flash . </s>
<s> We were slowing . </s>
<s> with more time I could have loosened a small burr or cotter pin -- </s>
<s> There was a blur just under my focus of vision , a crash ; ; </s>
<s> the car's far windshield panel turned into a silver web with a dark hole in the center . </s>
<s> `` S-s-sahjunt '' . </s>
<s> Two cars came over a crest , their chrome and glass flashing . </s>
<s> Eyes like hot honey , eyes that sizzled . </s>
<s> Plus flawless skin , smooth brow and cheeks , lips that looked as if you could get a shock from them . </s>
<s> Shall I go on '' ? ? </s>
<s> She smiled . </s>
<s> `` No , thanks '' . </s>
<s> `` I forgot '' ! ! </s>
<s> `` You and me both , dear . </s>
<s> `` Zing '' ! ! </s>
<s> I cried . </s>
<s> `` Why , yes . </s>
<s> Man , you rang -- it was in color , too , Miss , and Miss ? ? </s>
<s> That was a fun one '' . </s>
<s> It was fun for me , all right . </s>
<s> `` It depends on who does it . </s>
<s> I never wear anything at all . </s>
<s> `` I couldn't agree with you more '' . </s>
<s> She told me . </s>
<s> , Inc. . </s>
<s> Joyce went on , `` When we'd finished , Lou -- Mr. Thor -- asked me to stay a little longer . </s>
<s> `` So I just scooted out of his clutches . </s>
<s> She went on : </s>
<s> But I promised Joyce I would mention her name , if at all , only as a last resort . </s>
<s> There I got my Colt Special and shoulder harness , slipped my coat on , and went back into the front room . </s>
<s> `` Yes , I'm still all covered with that soap . </s>
<s> That always relaxes me . </s>
<s> So you'll have everything all to yourself , doggone '' </s>
<s> `` Well , goodbye '' , I said . </s>
<s> I spun about and clattered through the front room to the door . </s>
<s> Four cars were parked at the curb , and two of them were police radio cars . </s>
<s> At the pool's far end was the little cabana Joyce had mentioned , and on the water's surface floated scattered lavender patches of limp-looking lather . </s>
<s> He didn't push it ; ; </s>
<s> He filled me in . </s>
<s> `` What were they doing here '' ? ? </s>
<s> I asked Rawlins . </s>
<s> The PM might show he drowned instead , but that's what the once-over-lightly gives us . </s>
<s> I worked for my Uncle ( an Uncle by marriage so you will not think this has a mild undercurrent of incest ) who ran one of those antique shops in New Orleans' Vieux Carre , the old French Quarter . </s>
<s> I had a one-room studio which overlooked an ancient courtyard filled with flowers and plants , blooming everlastingly in the southern sun . </s>
<s> She looked more like twenty-five or six . </s>
<s> the calf was magnificent , the ankle perfect . </s>
<s> And that is the way I first saw her when my Uncle brought her into his antique store . </s>
<s> Something clicked in this instance , but I treated her circumspectly and I felt that she knew it , for we both kept our distance . </s>
<s> I dismissed these feelings as wishful thinking but I could not get it out of my head that we had a strong physical attraction for one another and we both feared to dwell on it because of our relationship . </s>
<s> He already had that slow pace that comes over the elderly , while she herself had all the signs of one who appreciates the joys of living . </s>
<s> or maybe she liked men old enough to be her father ; ; </s>
<s> I was waiting in front of it when she showed up and told me of my Uncle's indisposition . </s>
<s> Her mouth , which had been so much in my thoughts , was warm and moist and tender . </s>
<s> When we opened the door again for business and switched on the lights she said : </s>
<s> `` I know . </s>
<s> How will we work it out '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` I don't know '' , she said . </s>
<s> `` I guess we both felt it '' . </s>
<s> `` But you '' -- she began . </s>
<s> `` I don't understand '' , she insisted . </s>
<s> I heard subsequently that my Uncle and Aunt had dinner in a nearby restaurant in the French Quarter after which he went home to get into his costume to keep the date . </s>
<s> Shortly before nine I drove my jalopy to the street facing the Lake and parked the car in shadows far enough away from the rendezvous corner but near enough to keep the corner in clear view . </s>
<s> `` You cheap , no good , two-timing bitch ! ! </s>
<s> And he missed the point that the swarthy witches might be laughing at him for hoping to escape Nicolas Manas . </s>
<s> And when you get off this job tonight , well , you can gimme something to eat '' . </s>
<s> This was surely a reunion in art , it was all that poetry promised . </s>
<s> Mary Jane had smilingly said . </s>
<s> And I will greatly appreciate it if you will not tell your husband . </s>
<s> Smiling , she sat down on the suitcase and waited and watched . </s>
<s> His nose was tickled . </s>
<s> He belched , he stretched . </s>
<s> Shall we allow her not to have a bath ? ? </s>
<s> You shall see her at dinner '' . </s>
<s> when it stopped he began busily typing , sitting up in a virtuous way . </s>
<s> Singing into the mirror and his interested eyes , he was pleased to note , when he stripped for his own bath , that he still had the best part of his Italian sun tan . </s>
<s> He was asking had it been she who left the love note in his sheets ( she also served as maid ) when he saw the Grafin followed by a stately blond girl approaching his table . </s>
<s> Meredith began falling in love . </s>
<s> Fruit compote : `` If you think I would understand it '' ; ; </s>
<s> It tastes a little like poppyseed . </s>
<s> The husband points the steps out with his flashlight : `` Its white stare filling her pale eyes To the blind brim with appetite , Bleaching her hands that grazed my thighs And sent us from the table in surprise To let the dishes soak all night , '' ( Mary Jane asked herself if Meredith was blushing at this line , or was it the fire ? ? </s>
<s> Mary Jane took the page from him and began reading it , moving her lips with the words . </s>
<s> The third time rather urgently . </s>
<s> At her door , two or three hours later , Mary Jane whispered , `` Everyone is asleep '' . </s>
<s> suffocating air sapped their strength and strained their nerves to snapping ; ; </s>
<s> `` Hoa-whup '' ! ! </s>
<s> The dust-thick saliva came from his mouth like balled cotton . </s>
<s> She set the dipper on the edge of the deck , leaving it for him to stretch after it while she looked on scornfully . </s>
<s> His wide mouth compressed . </s>
<s> The bitterness of their wedding night still ripped within him like an open wound . </s>
<s> `` I suppose '' , he muttered , `` I can sell the outfit for enough to send you home to your folks , once we find a settlement '' . </s>
<s> Her laugh was hard . </s>
<s> They thought it would be a chance for you to make a life out where nobody will be thought any better than the next except for just what's inside of them . </s>
<s> The valley lay clear , and open to the eye , right up to the sharp-limbed line of gaunt , scoured hills that formed the horizon twenty miles ahead . </s>
<s> He had never seen clouds like them before , but he had the primitive feel of danger that gripped a man before a hurricane in Carolina . </s>
<s> They were engulfed by the weird silence , broken only by the low , angry murmur of the river . </s>
<s> Then the darkness thinned , and there was light again , and then bright sunlight . </s>
<s> There was no real sign of the river now , just a roiling , oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy waters that reached everywhere . </s>
<s> Out of compulsion to say something cheery , Ben Prime blurted , `` Well , we were lucky to be on soft ground when the first floodheads hit . </s>
<s> At least , the wheels dug in . </s>
<s> It speared up into the air , then sinking back , the up-jutting branch turned slowly . </s>
<s> He sputtered back to his feet and scrambled madly to pull his bags of seed grain forward . </s>
<s> The spokes were tight again , the iron tires gripped onto the wheels as if of one piece . </s>
<s> He got a small fire started and put on bacon and coffee . </s>
<s> The lifeboats were stuck fast . </s>
<s> Then the Bonaventure seemed to disintegrate with a roar of live steam , geysers of sparks and flames , and a dense cloud of black-and-orange smoke . </s>
<s> The big man with the whitened hair murmured something : his words sounded as if they were in the Manu tongue , which I recognized , having studied the dialect in my Anthropology 6 , class at the University of Chicago . </s>
<s> Of course , males play a role there , but believe me when I say you wouldn't enjoy yourself one bit on Eromonga . </s>
<s> `` I know something about Eromonga . </s>
<s> In a voice so frightened as to seem not his own , the big bo'sun's mate quavered : </s>
<s> I squinted at the looming shoreline . </s>
<s> it was perhaps 80 feet high and had been artfully constructed of logs . </s>
<s> He made a sound of despair deep in his throat . </s>
<s> I expected Brassnose -- as a man with a strain of Melanesian in his blood -- to speak to them . </s>
<s> She said , `` My name is Songau and these girls are Ponkob and Piwen . </s>
<s> I looked . </s>
<s> The body may have been two or three weeks' dead . </s>
<s> Brassnose turned a stricken face toward me and said brokenly , `` Sommers , you meddling Yank , you're a fool ! ! </s>
<s> but four Eromonga women are more than a match for the strongest male that ever lived . </s>
<s> In the Manu tongue , `` eromonga '' means manhood -- a quality which the women derisively toasted in weekly feasts at which great quantities of a brew like kava were imbibed . </s>
<s> In the hut to which I was assigned -- Max had his own quarters -- my food was brought to me by a wrinkled crone with bare drooping breasts who seemed to enjoy conversing with me in rudimentary phrases . </s>
<s> But in the middle of the last century an island woman named `` Karipo '' seized a spear in the heat of an inter-tribal battle and rallied the women after their men had fled . </s>
<s> `` All men went away from here . </s>
<s> Those who stayed had to pass tests . </s>
<s> `` Karipo's women then named this place ' Eromonga ' -- manhood -- for just the strongest men could stay here . </s>
<s> Anyway , he doesn't deserve to lie there in the sun and be stared at . </s>

<s> Ramey smiled but he thought to himself , I always see me too . </s>
<s> Never Benny . </s>
<s> It was a trick they used to try and conceal their identity when they followed trucks to check their speed . </s>
<s> The insurance man informed them that he had talked to Crumley who was all right and that he would watch the men's personal effects until they towed the rig back to town . </s>
<s> When they were ready to leave , Benson and Ramey walked back around the rear of the trailer . </s>
<s> `` There's a body you won't mind looking at '' , Benson said and they stopped . </s>
<s> `` What outfit does she drive for '' ? ? </s>
<s> She might have been someone he had once loved . </s>
<s> He had never seen her before , but now he thought of the manner in which he and Benson went in and out of the cities , at each end of their run . </s>
<s> How would you ever see her again ? ? </s>
<s> Benson said , and Ramey wondered how close their thoughts might have been . </s>
<s> Her glance swung past the trailer where the two drivers were standing . </s>
<s> The girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge that someone had spoken to her . </s>
<s> The man said , backing up a step , still looking down . </s>
<s> But what is it ? ? </s>
<s> Ramey could hear the crowd coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his shoulder had no identity or importance to him . </s>
<s> `` Why did you do it -- why did you hit him '' ? ? </s>
<s> Ramey looked around and caught sight of his partner near the front end of the wrecked truck talking to the patrolman . </s>
<s> Benson moved his arms , gesturing with an unfamiliar vigor and talking rapidly . </s>
<s> Ramey watched him coming with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer . </s>
<s> But her hands were calm , now . </s>
<s> Isn't that so '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` It was a king cobra , the largest you ever saw , and it deserved to live out its life in the jungle , didn't it ? ? </s>
<s> '' </s>
<s> `` All of us -- every goddam roach and worm and killer in that jungle . </s>

<s> Wing Commanders in the RAF do not imply survival in the future either in their orders or in their attitudes , to their men or to themselves . </s>
<s> And Keith's record of kills made him a man to listen to -- a man paradoxically , who might even survive . </s>
<s> And he would have enjoyed it just as much if he had been a Nazi . </s>
<s> Nowadays , we talk as though the blitz were just a short skirmish . </s>
<s> He was aware of her as a frightfully good-looking American WAC , a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work , ( regardless of how important she might have thought she was ) in the Command offices , but that was all . </s>
<s> They don't go for bull-like muscle , as a rule . </s>
<s> The pretty little twittering WACS said he had the look of eagles -- and Penny , hating the cliche , had to admit that in this case it applied . </s>
<s> The Command post was underground , and well camouflaged . </s>
<s> But there hadn't been enough time to build it for keeps . </s>
<s> There was a shattering , cracking sound as the concrete started to buckle , the air filled with dust and flying debris , and everyone in the room -- men and women hit the floor and used the desks as turtlebacks , as ordered . </s>
<s> Keith was on his feet because he didn't care at all about life any more : Penny on her feet , proudly , because she cared too much . </s>
<s> The great black leopards . </s>
<s> They came upon cheetal deer at woodland pools . </s>
<s> There were fantastic flowers without perfume , and gaudy birds without song . </s>
<s> Wild boar watched their progress with little pig eyes , and grunted derision when they didn't consider such game worthy of a shot from the . </s>
<s> He and his safety man , Herr Schaffner , swam up to the boarding ladder together . </s>

<s> `` I loused it '' , Rob said , with a savage note in his voice . </s>
<s> Not me , anyway . </s>
<s> He ran into the rapture of the depths . </s>
<s> and yet like a child among adults . </s>
<s> He went to Key West every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know that his title of `` Commodore '' was never used without irony . </s>
<s> `` Hi there , Schaffner '' , he had said . </s>
<s> `` Can I make you one '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` No thank you very much '' , Schaffner had answered in his accented English . </s>
<s> He was in his early forties , rather short and very compactly built , and with a manner that was reserved and stiff despite his efforts to adapt himself to American ways . </s>

<s> `` Well , no '' , Herr Schaffner said . </s>
<s> Shaffner looked at him , altogether without guile , and shrugged his shoulders , making a little spreading gesture with his two hands . </s>
<s> `` What do you mean '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` But surely you have misunderstood Mr. Roy . </s>
<s> Never , never did I offer him the exclusive rights . </s>

<s> The marines let him advance . </s>
<s> Matsuo had faked death and was pitched on a stack of corpses , both the burned and the unburned , the latter decomposing rapidly under the tropical sun . </s>
<s> While his comrades cocked the trap , that one behaved as if it was some dull maneuver . </s>
<s> When he got closer to the tree , Matsuo noted the wild look on his face . </s>
<s> They could come on him now without difficulty . </s>
<s> Matsuo jumped when the hidden arm flopped out . </s>
<s> With a snakestrike motion he grasped the hair , and , twisting , pulled the marine over on his back . </s>
<s> The bullet had penetrated in the area of the right collarbone ; ; </s>
<s> Matsuo put the bottle to his own lips . </s>
<s> Matsuo shook his head . </s>
<s> Not only had he no canteen , but he lacked even the belt to hang one on . </s>
<s> `` You came well equipped to die '' . </s>
<s> Some odor made him lean over the man . </s>

<s> The marine , hands on cheeks , rolled by his unwounded side onto his stomach . </s>
<s> What now ? ? </s>
<s> It was the marine : head lifted , he strained and called . </s>
<s> He performed the act twice more , and the begging in his tone grew more distinct . </s>
<s> The marine was a winehead . </s>

<s> The marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack . </s>
<s> Matsuo shook his head . </s>
<s> From the convulsive quivers of the man's shoulders it was plain he had resumed the weeping . </s>

<s> Tilghman's clenched fist swept over in a terrific right cross and clipped the big gunfighter on the side of his chin . </s>
<s> His head snapped round and he reeled back , crashing into the table where his buddies were sprawling . </s>
<s> A third shot doused the light . </s>
<s> `` Yes , George , but I ain't got poor old Pat's body yet . </s>
<s> Several were firing into the barn when Billy Tilghman arrived . </s>
<s> `` There's only one thing to move him fast , and we have it right here in this very store '' . </s>
<s> `` I'm gonna drop these into Blue Throat's lap '' , he announced , `` and I'd like every gun to be firing into that barn while I get near enough to toss 'em through the window '' . </s>
<s> Billy Tilghman did just that . </s>
<s> Led by Bill Doolin , these mobsters specialized in train robberies but as a sideline they looted stores and robbed banks , making liberal use of their guns . </s>
<s> On a bitterly cold day in January , 1895 , accompanied only by Neal Brown as his deputy , Tilghman left the township of Guthrie and headed for Rock Fort and Dunn's ranch . </s>
<s> `` Follow the river for five miles '' , he said hoarsely . </s>
<s> He left the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace and wondered by what remarkable stroke of Providence he had been allowed to come out alive . </s>
<s> He would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother and father knew -- thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell it on him . </s>
<s> She said , with the solicitude of a middle-aged woman for her only child . </s>
<s> Just then Charles Lever yelled , `` Hey , Jack '' , from the quarry road which ran behind the Carter house , and Jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen door , yelling `` Good-bye , Mom '' over his shoulder . </s>
<s> Charles said as they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away from the Dixie Highway , through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school . </s>
<s> His heart beat faster . </s>
<s> `` No , I mean how'd you get her to do it '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` Hell , I jist ask her '' . </s>
<s> `` Time for books '' , she yelled , jingling a little five-and-dime store bell in her right hand . </s>
<s> `` That's all right '' , she said , tossing her head back to get the hair out of her eyes . </s>
<s> He thought she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand go . </s>
<s> `` No more today . </s>
<s> `` Me neither '' , others said , and soon the game broke up , the children going off in pairs , in larger groups and alone . </s>
<s> Jack walked off alone out the road in the searing midday sun , past Robert Allen's three-room , tarpapered house , toward the field where the other boys were playing ball , thinking of what he would do in order to make Miss Langford have him stay in after school -- because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw the look in her eyes . </s>
<s> `` But I've got to take a chance on it '' , he told himself desperately . </s>
<s> `` All right , if you can't do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school is out '' , Miss Langford said firmly , not smiling . </s>

<s> One less shouldn't matter to him '' . </s>
<s> His bold eyes raked the woman , and a perceptive spectator might sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to owner . </s>
<s> The physician led the horses to the stable after a cursory glance at the cringing slave . </s>
<s> But he liked the smell of Delphine's perfume . </s>
<s> His pinched face showed the ravages of malnutrition . </s>
<s> Feebly he pointed an accusing finger at Madame Lalaurie and shouted : `` Evil woman ! ! </s>
<s> The ball broke up in confusion . </s>
<s> Dr. Lalaurie and I didn't even know he was in the house until the night of our ball when he came down the stairs '' . </s>
<s> Then , on July 2 , there occurred another incident which set tongues to wagging at a furious clip . </s>
<s> The girl was not more than 16 . </s>
<s> The bleeding girl was tiring fast ; ; </s>
<s> the coachman and Delphine were gaining on her as she raced down Perdido Street . </s>
<s> Ever since the hooch , and the trouble with the Quartet , and Midge and the child . </s>
<s> The boy lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor . </s>
<s> He was less to see , but Feathertop took him in , too , just to keep the records straight . </s>
<s> `` I vowed to take care of you -- and that's what I'm gonna do . </s>
<s> These two were going to be easy pickins . </s>
<s> `` I'm just a poor ex-jazz man , name of -- uh -- Boyd Smith '' . </s>
<s> `` Oh , come on , Cappy '' , the girl chided . </s>
<s> Feathertop watched the smooth scissoring of her slim , trim legs as she walked to the bags , and tucked them beneath her , smoothing the skirt out in a wide circle . </s>
<s> He cleared his throat ; ; </s>
<s> He had it all doped , of course . </s>
<s> Slug the kid , grab his dough -- at least enough to get to Philadelphia -- and then have a rockin' ball with the doll . </s>
<s> Certainly not , I mean , no that isn't what I said '' ! ! </s>
<s> She snapped at him . </s>
<s> `` Whyn't ya say so , fellow travelers ! ! </s>
<s> `` Why didn't he want you to get hitched '' ? ? </s>
<s> She looked down at her hands , too . </s>
<s> After a few seconds , she said , `` Dad didn't like Cappy . </s>
<s> `` Oh he was stupid , her old man ! ! </s>
<s> You never heard nothin' like it : Kitty's gonna go have an abortion , and Kitty's gonna go away to a convent , and Kitty's this and Kitty's that like he was nuts or somethin' , y'know '' ? ? </s>
<s> He thought , Pull out of it , old son . </s>
<s> Real big , with shoulders out to here , and hair all over him like a grizzly . </s>
<s> He threw his head back , closed his eyes , and belched ferociously . </s>
<s> `` Maybe you and me will , girlie , but these two ain't goin' nowhere '' . </s>
<s> The kid hit the bigger man with an audible thwump ! ! </s>
<s> The kid showed for an instant , and his arm was cocked back . </s>
<s> Then they were tumbling again , and the big man reached into the same pocket he had gone for earlier , and came up with a vicious switchblade . </s>
<s> He held the knife aloft an instant -- an instant enough to press the stud . </s>
<s> The blade came out with a snick ! ! </s>
<s> Kitty screamed insanely and her face was white . </s>
<s> They never called him by name , although he had one . </s>
<s> But this was not unusual , because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance from its elders . </s>
<s> But youth asked nothing of its parents -- not a touch of the hand or a kiss given in passing . </s>

<s> What did it matter to him that the park at the foot of Ash Road stretched beneath elevated trains that roared from the stucco station into the city's center at half-hour intervals ? ? </s>
<s> To him they were one and the same . </s>
<s> It slashed the sloping manure-scented lawns with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden porches . </s>
<s> It swayed with the wicker swings and screeched with the rusted hinges of screen doors . </s>
<s> Only one house on the street had no lawn before it . </s>
<s> Did the Old Man remember them there ? ? </s>
<s> It was as though he had made a pact with the devil himself , but it was not yet time to pay the price . </s>
<s> At fifteen he didn't care that he had no mother , that he couldn't remember her face or her touch ; ; </s>
<s> To him life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep . </s>
<s> He would sit inside the coffee shop and pound a gloved fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and come running , bowing with her running , calling out in her bowing , `` At your service '' . </s>
<s> He could do that when he would be a man . </s>
<s> She was only ten months older than he . </s>
<s> She leaned unconcerned against the broken porch fence , brushing and drying her wet , gilded hair in the sun . </s>
<s> Her face showed no sign of having heard Pompeii . </s>
<s> Pompeii called again , `` Laura '' ! ! </s>
<s> Pompeii rolled over . </s>
<s> His head undulated gradually , covering space , to come straining beneath the taut belly within the warmth of those teats . </s>
<s> Above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm cloud . </s>
<s> The Old Man near the corner let the shadow pass over him , sensing something portentous in it . </s>
<s> The room filled with smoke , and Maggie's head throbbed with excitement and fatigue , but Stuart had such a happy , earnest look of proud possession on his face that Maggie couldn't bear to do anything to quench it . </s>
<s> Little Anne rapidly outdistanced her mother in recovery . </s>
<s> She was so heavy that Maggie's arms shook from lifting her and taking care of her . </s>
<s> Mr. Clifton would have preferred death and bankruptcy to having his son stay with his wife's people without contributing to his and his family's upkeep , and besides that there were the things that had to be bought for the baby , milk and orange juice and vitamins and soap , just plain soap . </s>
<s> `` It would make me feel a lot better , but the Woman's Exchange isn't taking baked goods any more and I can't leave the baby with Grandma because she isn't strong enough and the baby's too young to be put in a nursery '' . </s>
<s> She picked up the baby and nuzzled her fat warm little neck . </s>
<s> I do seem to snap at everybody these days , but I would like to think of a way to make a little extra money '' . </s>
<s> `` What about a tea room , then ? ? </s>
<s> And Grandma isn't strong enough to take on something like that , and to tell you the truth neither am I '' . </s>
<s> Shivering , people talked and argued ; ; </s>
<s> Something had to be done ; ; </s>
<s> Something had to be done about the furnace , the fuel bills , the washing machine , the doctor and dentist bills , about making money stretch for food , for the mortgage , for taxes , for shoes , for half soles , for overshoes , for clothes , for the new leaks in the roof , for gas and light bills ; ; </s>

<s> Zion was surprised when Roy's buggy stopped beside her on the pike one early summer day as she was walking home from the country school where she was teaching now that Eph Showers had had a call to preach in some mountain town . </s>
<s> She found herself wishing an old wish , that she had told Doaty she was running away , that she had left something more behind her than the loving , sorry note and her best garnet pin . </s>
<s> But I would have gone anyway , thought Henrietta . </s>
<s> If Adelia had felt about someone as Henrietta felt about Charles , would she have run away with him ? ? </s>
<s> A curious thought to end a curious night . </s>
<s> She closed her eyes , remembering the small French cemetery , enclosed by stone walls . </s>
<s> Leaning out , she could see a tangle of rosebush and honeysuckle , one not quite come to bloom , one just beyond it . </s>
<s> Feeling protective toward this sleeping being , Henrietta found a yesterday bun and milk in a white jug , a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of going barefoot . </s>
<s> `` Don't remember , do you '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` Not so well's I remember you '' , he said . </s>
<s> Ran away on a black night with a lawful wedded man . </s>
<s> `` Can't blame a man for leavin' his wife '' , he said quite cheerfully . </s>
<s> `` Probably '' , said Henrietta dryly . </s>

<s> He beat the air with his stick , and it fell from his claws and clattered on the stones . </s>
<s> At the edge of the field , the wild rolling land took over , dotted with fat round bushes like sheep . </s>
<s> The air was full of sounds too but placid ones , a terrestrial humming as much out of the earth as out of the blue sky . </s>
<s> Apparently they were of Caucasian blood . </s>
<s> Her nose was higher of bridge , her complexion so pale as to be quite susceptible to sunburn , and the fish and vegetable diet of her forebears had given her teeth that were white and regular and strong . </s>
<s> It was as if foreign duty implied and excused license ; ; </s>
<s> Then the young man in the brown sports jacket spoke , and it was no different . </s>
<s> Tommy said out of her cold rage . </s>
<s> `` I don't believe I know you , and I can't understand your quaint brand of English -- it was meant to be English , wasn't it '' ? ? </s>

<s> When Owen was finally rid of him , there was a timid rap at the door . </s>
<s> `` Yes '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` How do you do '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` Why is that '' ? ? </s>
<s> She apparently wasn't satisfied with his reaction . </s>
<s> There was a slight nervous twitch in the region of her left eye . </s>
<s> Forebearing , Owen kept his peace . </s>
<s> I feel it's my duty . </s>
<s> But what do you want to do about the lay-sisters ? ? </s>
<s> `` Leave a card or something . </s>
<s> She stood indecisively for a moment , then walked down the hall ; ; </s>
<s> It took him about fifteen minutes to calm himself ; ; </s>
<s> His lawyer had sent him a statement on his overdue alimony , and there was a letter from the Collector of Internal Revenue asking him to stop in his office and explain last year's exemptions . </s>
<s> With any luck at all he could easily find a flowerpot . </s>
<s> There were more women than men in the place , but he couldn't find a flowerpot . </s>

<s> `` I keep all these plays in this little black book , and I watch over a twelve-hour period to find out what numbers are repeating . </s>
<s> This proved conclusively that The Wrangler was a jinx , so he walked on down to Hurrays , an even more glorified gambling den than the Golden Calf . </s>

<s> Who reported to you the disappearance of handspikes and heavers and who '' -- </s>
<s> He bellowed orders and watched the alert response of some of his men and watched , too , the way a dozen or more turned their heads questioningly toward the shackled figure as though for further instruction . </s>
<s> Wilson , shackled and snarling , was thrown with the other prisoners and was soon joined by Green , McKee and McKinley . </s>
<s> In the tiny cabin , Alexander met with Gansevoort , Heiser and Wales to speak and to listen . </s>

<s> `` We are going to bring the Somers into New York harbor safe and sound '' . </s>
<s> He paused , then added , `` Everything on a ship is a weapon . </s>
<s> Alexander said . </s>
<s> Yes , he would bring the Somers safely into New York harbor but at a price . </s>
<s> Dear God , at what a price . </s>
<s> Stern-faced , he inspected the prisoners , satisfying himself that they were clean , well fed and comfortable within reason . </s>
<s> Only Cromwell , the giant boatswain , was mild-mannered and respectful . </s>
<s> He said , `` Captain , may I speak , please ? ? </s>
<s> `` You are the only man aboard who can be in doubt '' . </s>
<s> Now Spencer , seeming with effort to shake himself from lethargy , spoke . </s>
<s> Alexander shifted his gaze to Spencer . </s>
<s> The calmness and detachment of his tone suggested unawareness of how implicit was his own guilt in the words he had used to defend Cromwell . </s>
<s> `` Nothing to lose , either , Spencer '' . </s>
<s> Some of these apprentices were , in physical strength , already men and doubtless a percentage of them were Spencer's followers . </s>

<s> He nodded , clasping and unclasping his hands over his paunch , and flicked glances at me . </s>
<s> He left us . </s>
<s> He turned his surly , half-closed eyes toward us , stared for a second , then shouted in Yiddish , `` One , two , three '' ! ! </s>

<s> He can even be a mild-voiced little-town guy with big-town ideas and level gray eyes and a heart even Houdini couldn't figure out , how it is unlocked . </s>
<s> If it is love , you don't . </s>
<s> And you know you will always wonder all of your life whether it was because you wanted him so bad that you didn't get him , and you can feel nearly sorry enough to cry when you think of that other guy , the chump who begged you to marry him , the one with the plastered hair and the car he couldn't afford and the too-shiny shoes . </s>

<s> he would look right through you while you were talking to him , and if you said , `` For Christ's sake , Donald , you've got Prussian blue all over your shirt '' , he would smile , and nod , and an hour later the paint would be all over his pants as well . </s>
<s> Mrs. Monmouth thought of him as her discovery , and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a painting . </s>
<s> It was all gravy , and Donald didn't need much to live on ; ; </s>
<s> He didn't look like what I thought of as an old man , and his lively and erudite speech made him seem even younger . </s>
<s> `` No , I take classes with different people '' , he said . </s>
<s> He made a circle with his thumb and fingers . </s>
<s> `` The artist is like a fragment of a mosaic -- no , he is more than that , a virtuoso performer in some vast philharmonic . </s>

<s> We hold safe little jobs illustrating tooth-paste ads or the salacious incidents in trivial novels , and most of our easel painting is nothing but picking the fluff out of the navel so it can be contemplated in greater purity . </s>
<s> It was an awkward hour , but I didn't have to punch any time clock , and it only meant that sometimes I had to stay a couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job . </s>

<s> `` Well , at least you won't have to do that '' , she was saying . </s>

<s> It had started two years ago when he was in an iron lung . </s>
<s> Everybody knew that John Cooper had married Edythe on the rebound . </s>
<s> It was the kind of thing that could ruin a man's life , and it was a tribute to John's strength of character and very real business ability that it hadn't ruined his . </s>
<s> John had claimed her from the stag line , a young man a year out of Dartmouth with skiing crinkles still around his eyes . </s>
<s> You talked about John-and-Linda as an entity . </s>
<s> It got worse instead of better . </s>
<s> And then there was Linda's engagement to Bobbie Evans . </s>
<s> He was a bright and handsome young man from New York , who worked for the same steel company as John did . </s>
<s> It was simply Poor John . </s>

<s> John was at the church with Edythe . </s>
<s> `` Poor John '' ! ! </s>
<s> She didn't have a bad shape when you caught her at the pool at Longue Vue , but her bathing suits were far from smart . </s>
<s> There was no one who would blame her or John ; ; </s>
<s> So when old Mr. Lovejoy , the company president , talked about putting in a single sales manager for both branches after the head of the regular steels had gone with Carnegie-Illinois , it looked like the perfect chance for Bobbie . </s>
<s> Lord knows I had everything set for you '' . </s>
<s> Bobbie , with Linda behind him , will have plenty of other opportunities . </s>
<s> After the surprise was over , Linda was almost as pleased as anyone with John's good luck , though she agreed with Bobbie's decision some months later to move to Funk Furnaces . </s>
<s> `` Shirley appreciated the chance to make some money . </s>

<s> `` Janice , could you possibly go over and make sure everything's all right ? ? </s>

<s> But because there was the chance that something had gone wrong at the apartment , and if I didn't go over , who would ? ? </s>
<s> I just came over to make sure everything was all right '' . </s>
<s> `` I'm -- hard to wake up '' , she faltered . </s>
<s> And Nadine insisted that her sitters be reliable ! ! </s>
<s> I told Nadine everything was fine , and that I'd be getting on home . </s>
<s> `` Wally's drunk -- I'll get him out of here as soon as I possibly can , but I don't want Shirley to see him like this . </s>
<s> She didn't even give me a chance to refuse . </s>
<s> I had always thought she was so beautiful . </s>
<s> `` Pack your clothes '' , she hissed . </s>
<s> He lurched and stumbled to the davenport and sank down on it , and was instantly asleep . </s>
<s> `` You stay out of this '' , she spat at me . </s>
<s> `` How can you be so damn stupid ? ? </s>
<s> You'll wake up the whole building . </s>
<s> `` In the morning you and Wally can talk things out '' -- </s>
<s> She collapsed against me , as if everything inside her snapped . </s>
<s> In the afternoon Nadine and Wally came over with Francie . </s>
<s> Wally sat in our big chair , his hands between his knees , looking ready to cry . </s>
<s> Mr. Thom had gotten Wally on the phone , and fired him . </s>
<s> `` I thought I'd smooth things over through Ken '' , Wally said miserably . </s>
<s> `` But Ken got coy and wouldn't make any promises . </s>
<s> But I couldn't help thinking that Nadine and Wally were getting just what they deserved . </s>
<s> When A bubble breaks , there's nothing . </s>
<s> On top of everything else they were two months behind on their apartment rent , and the day Wally received written notice that he was fired , they were evicted . </s>
<s> `` I'm glad you feel that way , honey . </s>
<s> Straightened out -- They'd had years of making all that money ! ! </s>
<s> Then I felt uncomfortable , too . </s>
<s> His luck had failed him , and it was easier to crawl off into bed than to get out and fight the world . </s>
<s> While I worked , Nadine sat and cried . </s>
<s> But the two weeks dragged into three , and they were still with us . </s>
<s> A profession that brought me as good an income as mine wasn't to be sneezed at . </s>
<s> I was lucky in lots of ways , no doubt about it . </s>
<s> Growing up without a mother from the time she was three -- it wasn't a good thing for a child , even knowing the kind of mother Alice had been . </s>
<s> I had a feeling that young Pete Michelson , the most promising intern at Fairview , had something to do with it , too . </s>
<s> She'd been out with Pete the night before and her gay chatter about their date lightened my mood a little . </s>
<s> Two interns and Dick Ishii , the other resident . </s>
<s> I'm Chief of Medicine here and this morning would start like all others , with me taking the boys on the rounds . </s>
<s> Pete was down on Seven , Dick told me , and he'd meet us there . </s>
<s> Seven is a women's floor and , as it happened , not very busy right then . </s>
<s> An ugly scar disfigured the somewhat familiar puffy face , already marred by the tell-tale network of broken red veins that heavy drinkers carry . </s>
<s> Her coarse hair was two-colored -- bleached blonde and its real , dirty gray . </s>
<s> In a low voice , Dick filled us in </s>
<s> `` Hey '' ! ! </s>
<s> `` What's this '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` Have you spoken to a doctor about it '' ? ? </s>
<s> I told Miss Groggins to move her down the hall where we had an examining table . </s>
<s> On my way to the elevator , I ran into Pete . </s>
<s> Class Three , they said . </s>

<s> I grimaced in distaste . </s>
<s> Her eyes opened as soon as she heard me , though , and once again , I felt an inward shiver . </s>

<s> I looked at the pathetic wreck of a woman before me . </s>
<s> If I let her go , she'd disappear once more . </s>
<s> Only the dive itself had any meaning . </s>
<s> It was when I packed up what duds I had and went to Paris . </s>
<s> Wild kicks never are , but I hoped to dig up a better frame of mind . </s>
<s> She was eating bread and cheese just as fast as she possibly could , and washing it down with red wine . </s>
<s> She was a nymphomaniac , of course , the poor girl . </s>
<s> Toward the break of day I waxed philosophical , and drew analogies about her way of eating bread and cheese . </s>
<s> The next morning a little cognac made me feel better -- but what can you do in Paris on Sunday morning ? ? </s>
<s> I felt better Tuesday evening when I woke up . </s>
<s> Sometime earlier the weather had turned cold and it was snowing . </s>
<s> She was silent for a while , then said , `` Why are you so unhappy '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` Is it a woman '' ? ? </s>
<s> Her eyes were smiling , too , but so sadly , and there was tiredness and infinite wisdom in them . </s>
<s> `` Now isn't it better to smile '' ? ? </s>
<s> She tilted up and drank , and then I drank . </s>
<s> I wasn't going to lug around a glass . </s>
<s> No child , this tart , she must have been thirty-five or even forty . </s>
<s> Not good looking , but self-confident and wise so that it made her attractive . </s>
<s> I liked her , and all at once I was glad she was there . </s>
<s> We seemed to be drowsing , sadly , soberly , in the cold , cold air while the snow fell . </s>
<s> Then she said , `` Allons '' , and we got up and went to my hotel without another word . </s>
<s> We undressed and made love with the comfortable acceptance I had once known with Valery . </s>
<s> She had a funny little scar on her stomach , on the left side . </s>
<s> I wondered if I ought to go use the new one myself . </s>
<s> Her name was Suzanne , and mine Stephen . </s>
<s> `` I carry one in my purse . </s>
<s> She smiled all the way to her wise , sad eyes , and drained her own . </s>
<s> He must have thought I was a tourist . </s>
<s> I fixed him with a steely eye and said , `` What's this for ? ? </s>
<s> Two letters had arrived for Miss Theresa Stubblefield : she put them in her bag . </s>
<s> She would see them , looking just as they had in the books , and this would make up a part of her delight . </s>
<s> She had heard about it the night before at her hotel . </s>
<s> Marvelous , thought Theresa , climbing in her portly , well-bred way , for she was someone who had learned that if you only move slowly enough you have time to notice everything . </s>
<s> Theresa sat with her letters in her lap , breathing Mediterranean air . </s>
<s> Poor Cousin Elec , she thought , tears rising to sting in the sun , but why couldn't he have arranged to live through the summer ? ? </s>
<s> And how on earth did I ever get this letter anyway ? ? </s>
<s> No return address whatsoever . </s>
<s> Somebody had scrawled American Express , Piazza di Spagna ? ? </s>
<s> This letter would have got to me if she hadn't even put Rome , Italy , on it . </s>
<s> Theresa had seen him through the right college , into the right fraternity , and though pursued by various girls and various mammas of girls , safely married to the right sort , however much in the early years of that match his wife , Anne , had not seemed to understand poor George . </s>
<s> But there is more in this than meets the eye . </s>
<s> The wallpaper in the back bedroom is literally crumbling off . </s>
<s> ) `` I hope if you have any ideas along these lines you will write me about them . </s>
<s> I may settle on some makeshift arrangements for the summer and wait until you return in the fall so we can work out together the best . </s>
<s> I'll start sneezing in a minute , sitting on these cold steps . </s>
<s> `` No '' , said Theresa . </s>
<s> Theresa turned away to escape , and climbed to a higher landing where the steps divided in two . </s>
<s> They even talked about Lucille down at the Young Christians' League where I spent a lot of time in Bible classes and helping out with the office work for our foreign mission . </s>
<s> My folks and my faith protected me from things like that . </s>
<s> He gave me a straight , honest answer . </s>
<s> He wasn't only different -- he was it . </s>
<s> And now Lucille Warren had gotten a look at him . </s>
<s> She wouldn't have , even if he'd asked her . </s>
<s> He was too honorable to leave his wife penniless and leave those helpless children without their daddy . </s>
<s> Johnnie loved me and wanted me . </s>
<s> It was weeks before we even kissed for the first time . </s>
<s> `` And '' , I was ticking off the items on my fingers , `` swears too much and goes out with the boys , whoever they are , too much , and who ever goes to church and won't even listen when I try to persuade him to come back to the fold '' . </s>
<s> He'd just admitted it to me . </s>
<s> Johnnie and I had been innocent in our love , and that was the way I wanted to keep it . </s>
<s> But then he had said , `` All right , kid , if that's how you want it , that's how it'll be '' . </s>
<s> I wanted him , with a terrifying fierceness . </s>
<s> Astonishingly enough , it was my own voice I heard there in the darkness , begging this man to make love to me . </s>
<s> `` I will , kitten '' ! ! </s>
<s> `` Uh huh . </s>
<s> Always '' . </s>
<s> Idiot's delight , I later discovered . </s>
<s> I had also thought a lot about how God must look on true love , and so in a way I was keeping my promise to God , my promise to remain pure until I was married . </s>
<s> Wouldn't Johnnie do practically anything in the world to insure my happiness ? ? </s>
<s> `` Uh-huh . </s>
<s> Love you '' . </s>
<s> So I went to Boston . </s>
<s> The first meeting was held in Faneuil Hall , a great big place where we were able to meet members from all the other states . </s>
<s> `` Well , I should find Alma '' -- I began . </s>
<s> My folks wouldn't dream of having alcohol in the house , so my first taste of it had been -- of course -- with Johnnie . </s>
<s> But when Johnnie disguised the taste with ginger ale , I enjoyed it . </s>
<s> Not for me '' . </s>
<s> Then he remembered . </s>
<s> Share bath , maybe -- but share refrigerator ? ? </s>
<s> He remembered seeing it last night , when he put away his small store of bachelor-type eatables . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , he had this miserable cold , and as he leaned against the refrigerator , watching the rain make sandy puddles at his feet , the doctor's prescription for lots of sun seemed like a hollow mockery . </s>
<s> `` I've got this cold . </s>
<s> As for its being fine , day after tomorrow , he had the unhappy conviction that it would never be fine again , with Vivian lost to him forever . </s>
<s> Must have really smelled up her sweater , he thought , and wondered idly just why she kept the sweater fast-frozen . </s>
<s> He mused aloud . </s>
<s> `` Oh , yes . </s>
<s> I must remember to warn the girl next to you in Larkspur . </s>
<s> Surely there was a better word . </s>
<s> When Charlie came up from the beach for his four-o'clock pill , the whole establishment ( gaudy enough when seen through mist and fog ) looked like a floodlit modern painting -- great blocks of dizzy color , punctuated at regular intervals by the glaring white of five community refrigerators . </s>
<s> No wonder she was so pale , wearing all those cold clothes . </s>
<s> He got a red pill and a beer and then , on impulse , transferred the rest of his salami to her side of the refrigerator and scrawled `` Be my guest '' on the wrapping . </s>
<s> What's puny '' ? ? </s>
<s> The new Riverside pitcher turned out to have an overhand fast ball that took a hop . </s>
<s> `` Third ! ! </s>
<s> Third base '' ! ! </s>
<s> Eddie shouted . </s>
<s> He came into the bag with his body and Mike Deegan brought the ball down full in his face . </s>
<s> The fighters were separated in a few minutes . </s>
<s> But Mike Deegan was boiling mad now . </s>
<s> This so infuriated Deegan that he spun around and said : `` I'll get that little bastard . </s>
<s> So help me God , I'll get him '' . </s>
<s> All Deegan had to do was slide , fall away , but instead , he rammed into the catcher . </s>
<s> Then the manager called for a doctor . </s>
<s> Mike sat quietly watching the manager come nearer . </s>
<s> In the Riverside dugout Frankie Ricco , shortstop , whispered into Phil's ear : `` There's gonna be a fight '' . </s>
<s> Mike was slow getting into the box this time . </s>
<s> Mike and the Anniston pitcher were pulled away before they even came together . </s>
<s> Phil Rossoff and two other Riverside players did not go out on the field when the fighting started . </s>
<s> `` I didn't think it was necessary '' . </s>
<s> `` Listen , wise guy , if you think I'm gonna do all the fighting for this ball club you're crazy '' . </s>
<s> Phil turned away and opened his locker , and then he heard Mike Deegan say : `` You're yellow , Rossoff '' ! ! </s>
<s> `` Phil , come into my office '' , Eddie said . </s>
<s> `` You get your unconditional release as of today '' . </s>
<s> `` I'm not saying you're yellow . </s>
<s> But what you haven't got is the heart to back up that talent with . </s>
<s> The heart , Phil . </s>
<s> What the hell do you think baseball is ? ? </s>
<s> There were other clubs in this league . </s>
<s> Phil did not answer . </s>
<s> He just didn't know what he was talking about , saying a thing like that . </s>
<s> Frankie nodded . </s>
<s> `` I'll talk to him , all right '' . </s>
<s> `` I'm not worried about it '' , Phil said . </s>
<s> Richard's next interest seemed the product of his insularity . </s>
<s> At dinner one night , when he was fourteen , Richard announced , `` There is only one god '' . </s>
<s> `` You don't understand '' , Richard said gloomily . </s>
<s> Through quiet laughter his mother said , `` Don't speak to your father like that , Richard '' . </s>
<s> Although he still didn't speak to anyone , he grew fond of saying , `` The future lies in Asia '' , when the opportunity arose , and when he graduated from high school his parents sent him to New York to give him a foundation , they said , for his life in Asian studies . </s>
<s> Richard left America with his clothes , his biwa and his image of Acala and , on the freighter which took him to Japan , he plucked at the biwa , trying to make the sounds he wrought resemble an ancient Japanese tune he had once heard . </s>
<s> In Tokyo Richard took up a life similar to that which he had lived in New York , except that he had replaced his biwa with a friend . </s>
<s> An American student named Charlotte Adams had refused to take notice of his evident aversion to people and had at last succeeded in getting him to talk to her . </s>
<s> He had nothing much to say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied her on some of her unusually searching tours of Tokyo . </s>
<s> She convinced him that he ought to be a member of some of the small tea-drinking parties she held at her rooms and in the end he complied with her wishes , although it was only rarely that he added anything to the random conversations . </s>
<s> `` Did you watch him '' ? ? </s>
<s> `` I shouldn't have been able to do that '' . </s>
<s> `` My God , it was cold today '' , said Samuel Burns . </s>
<s> Richard's dark eyes came up and seemed for the tiniest moment to reflect sharp light . </s>
<s> Instead , he walked around the temple and mounted still another flight of stairs and stood before the seated Fudo at their head . </s>
<s> He pretended that the lath was a tractor and he would drag it through the dirt and make buzzing , tractor sounds with his lips . </s>
<s> I had never liked snakes much , I still had that kind of quick panic that I'd had as a child whenever I saw one , but this snake was clean and bright and very beautiful . </s>
<s> He was multi-colored and graceful and he lay in the furrow and moved his arched and tapered head only so slightly . </s>
<s> His flat and gracefully tapered head lifted as I looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that solemn mouth . </s>
<s> I picked him up , and the length of him arched very carefully and gracefully and only a little wildly , and I could feel the coolness of that radiant , fire-colored body , like splendid ice , and I knew that he had eaten only recently because there were two whole and solid little lumps in the forepart of him , like fieldmice swallowed whole might make . </s>
<s> The body caressed through my hands like cool satin , and my hands , usually tanned and dark , were pale beside it , and I asked it where the fire colors could come from the coolness of that body . </s>
<s> I felt good and satisfied , looking at the snake . </s>
<s> I got on the tractor again and I had to watch the plow closely because the field was drawn across the long hillside and even in that good soil there was a danger of rocks . </s>
<s> It was no use . </s>
<s> The boy waited at the corner , with the jar of water held up to me in his hands , and the water had grown bubbly in the heat of the morning . </s>
<s> He was eleven and we had done many things together . </s>
<s> He waited there and he smiled as the tractor came up , as he would smile on any other day . </s>
<s> I looked closely at his eyes , and he was already innocent ; ; </s>
<s> it was a big one '' . </s>
<s> `` You saw the colors of it , didn't you ? ? </s>
<s> the colors of its back were dull and gray-looking , torn and smashed in , and dirty from the boy's shoes . </s>
<s> The snake was hideous , and I remembered , even then , the cool , bright fire of it only a little while before , and I thought perhaps the boy had always seen it dead and hideous like that , and had not even stopped to see the beauty of it in its life . </s>
<s> I could have slapped the boy . </s>
<s> I thought , you little brute , you nasty , selfish , little beast , with brutality already developed within that brain and in those eyes . </s>
<s> Cady didn't come unglued easily , but this had not been a day of glad tidings . </s>
<s> It wouldn't help anyway . </s>

<s> Mr. Partlow banged his fist on the keyboard , ruining the letter . </s>
<s> He finished with a flurry of good wishes to Hanford College and signed the letter . </s>
<s> Then he met the grave eyes of his wife , Anne , from the photograph next to David's . </s>
<s> After all , his wife had written most of his letters for him in those first lean days of Partlow Products . </s>
<s> `` I was just thinking how things have changed . </s>
<s> But tonight his drink tasted like branch water and even his favorite meal of steak and tossed salad gave no surcease from the growing weight of the letter in his pocket . </s>

<s> `` All right . </s>

<s> He remembered the first time he saw her , standing across the room at a party . </s>
<s> There was too little occasion beforehand for resistance , the brave strong delights of emotional clash and meeting . </s>

<s> Martin realized , later on , that he should have `` had it out '' with Dolores that night . </s>
<s> And if he surrendered after raving at her . </s>
<s> At once . </s>
<s> He considered the sober possibility . </s>

<s> Quite a few laughed . </s>

<s> He was trapped . </s>
<s> On the other hand , if she didn't remove her own things , it would be difficult to explain to the parade of guests which traversed the apartment . </s>
<s> Martin guessed that Dolores would not be so eager to tell the next installment of her story . </s>
<s> She had used his rumpled shorts as the very image of his childishness , his lack of control , his general male looseness , while she remained cool , airy , and untouched , the charming teacher who disciplined an unruly body . </s>
